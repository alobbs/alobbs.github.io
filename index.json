Infrastructure issues included Redis message queue drops during Elasticsearch node failures, bulk indexing failures due to node failures, and large indices exceeding Lucene\u0026rsquo;s ~2 billion message limit. System scaling challenges involved high overhead in large clusters (\u0026gt;200 nodes), difficulty performing rolling upgrades, and large guild indices causing indexing and query performance issues. Transition to Kubernetes deployment with Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK) enabled automated upgrades and safer rolling restarts. Implemented a multi-cluster \u0026ldquo;cell\u0026rdquo; architecture with smaller, dedicated Elasticsearch clusters per cell, each with dedicated ingest, master, and data nodes, distributed across zones for resilience. Switched message queue from Redis to Google Cloud PubSub for guaranteed delivery and backlog handling. Batch messages by cluster and index before bulk indexing, using a PubSub message router with Tokio tasks to group messages by destination, improving fault tolerance. Introduced \u0026ldquo;cells\u0026rdquo; of Elasticsearch clusters to support cross-DM search by sharding messages by user ID into separate user-dm-messages cells. Created dedicated Elasticsearch clusters with multiple primary shards for \u0026ldquo;Big Freaking Guilds\u0026rdquo; (BFGs) approaching Lucene\u0026rsquo;s max doc limit, enabling scalable search for large guilds. Reindexing BFGs involves dual indexing, creating larger indices with more shards, and switching query traffic after validation, maintaining continuous search availability. Results include indexing trillions of messages, doubling throughput, reducing median query latency from 500ms to under 100ms, and managing 40 Elasticsearch clusters with thousands of indices, enabling automated upgrades and zero service impact. \u0026ldquo;NetEase CEO Steps Back as Company Shifts Strategy Away from Gaming\u0026rdquo; NetEase is restructuring leadership as CEO William Ding reduces involvement in gaming, signaling a strategic shift away from game development amid regulatory and market pressures.\nNetEase executives, including CEO William Ding, are stepping down amid strategic shifts, with Ding reducing his involvement in game development The company is pulling back from its gaming business to focus on other areas, reflecting a broader corporate restructuring The leadership changes follow a period of regulatory scrutiny and market challenges in China\u0026rsquo;s gaming industry CISA warns of risks after Oracle cloud data breach exposes customer credentials CISA issued an alert after Oracle\u0026rsquo;s cloud infrastructure was compromised, exposing customer credentials and emphasizing the need for password resets, log monitoring, and MFA.\nCISA issued an alert regarding Oracle\u0026rsquo;s public cloud data breach, advising credential management and security measures.

The expansion is part of a broader effort by Washtenaw County to connect over 3,000 households, with a focus on underserved, lower-income areas.\nBotnet Part 2: The Web is Broken - Jan Wildeboer’s Blog Key Facts Companies like Infatica monetize network bandwidth via SDKs embedded in iOS, Android, MacOS, and Windows apps, enabling web crawling and scraping using infected devices. These SDKs sell access to millions of residential, static, and mobile IP addresses, facilitating large-scale AI web scraping and brute-force attacks. Trend Micro\u0026rsquo;s 2023 research confirms malicious repacking of freeware/shareware to conduct drive-by downloads of these proxy services, contributing to increased bot traffic and server overloads. Summary Jan Wildeboer highlights the proliferation of shady business models where app developers embed SDKs, such as Infatica’s, into their applications to monetize users’ network bandwidth. These SDKs enable the creation of botnets that leverage infected devices to perform web crawling, brute-force mail server attacks, and AI-driven web scraping, often using millions of residential, static, and mobile IP addresses. Trend Micro’s 2023 investigation confirms malicious repacking of freeware/shareware to facilitate drive-by downloads of these proxy services, exacerbating botnet activity. Wildeboer argues that this business model effectively causes DDoS-like traffic surges, impacting small web services and increasing the difficulty for server administrators to detect and block such malicious activity. He advocates that all web scraping should be considered abusive and recommends blocking such traffic, emphasizing that inclusion of SDKs for profit in apps makes developers complicit in malware distribution and botnet formation. The market for residential proxies, driven by AI web scraping demands, is expanding rapidly, with many providers relying on SDK injection into third-party apps. Wildeboer concludes that this trend undermines the web’s foundational integrity, urging webmasters and admins to remain vigilant against these evolving threats.\nWhistleblower: DOGE Siphoned NLRB Case Data – Krebs on Security Key Facts A whistleblower from the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) alleges that DOGE employees transferred gigabytes of sensitive case data in early March using short-lived accounts with restricted logging. The data exfiltration involved approximately 10 GB from the NxGen case management system, with suspicious activity including creation of high-privilege accounts and use of containers to obfuscate activity. The whistleblower reports blocked login attempts from a Russian IP address shortly after account creation, along with unauthorized download of code libraries used for web scraping and brute-force attacks. The NLRB investigated but was reportedly instructed to cease reporting to US-CERT, and the agency\u0026rsquo;s control was later removed from all employee accounts. Summary A security architect at the NLRB, Daniel J. Berulis, alleges that employees from Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) siphoned sensitive case data in early March by creating high-privilege accounts with logging restrictions and using containerized environments to conceal activities. The incident involved transferring approximately 10 GB of data from the NxGen system, which contains confidential information on unions, legal cases, and corporate secrets. Suspicious activity included multiple blocked login attempts from a Russian IP address (83.149.30.186) shortly after account creation, with attempts to use valid credentials, and the download of code libraries designed for web scraping and brute-force attacks from GitHub. Berulis observed that network logs for recent resources went missing, and Microsoft Azure monitoring was turned off during the incident. Despite raising alarms and reporting to US-CERT, the NLRB was allegedly ordered to halt further investigation, and control over its systems was later revoked from staff. The whistleblower’s disclosures, supported by internal documentation and expert review, highlight potential security breaches involving high-level access and covert data exfiltration, amid broader political tensions and legal disputes involving Musk’s companies and government agencies.\nAn Intro to DeepSeek\u0026rsquo;s Distributed File System | Some blog Key Facts 3FS (Fire-Flyer File System) is an open-source distributed filesystem released by DeepSeek on April 15, 2025 Core components include Meta, Mgmtd, Storage, and Client nodes, with Mgmtd managing node registration and cluster configuration Utilizes CRAQ (Chain Replication with Apportioned Queries) protocol for strong consistency, with write throughput limited by the slowest node in the chain and performance affected by workload types Summary DeepSeek introduced 3FS, a distributed filesystem designed to abstract data across multiple machines, enabling applications to interact with it as if it were a local filesystem. It consists of four primary node types: Meta (manages file metadata stored in inodes and DirEntries within FoundationDB), Mgmtd (controls cluster configuration and node health via heartbeats and node discovery), Storage (handles physical data chunks using a Rust-based ChunkEngine, with metadata stored in LevelDB), and Client (interfaces with other nodes for file operations and data transfer). The system employs CRAQ for fault-tolerant, strongly consistent data replication, where write operations propagate from head to tail nodes, marking entries as \u0026ldquo;dirty\u0026rdquo; until committed, with read operations querying the tail for the most recent clean data. CRAQ\u0026rsquo;s performance varies with workload, offering scalable, low-latency reads but higher write latency, especially under zipfian access patterns. The architecture emphasizes fault tolerance, scalability, and simplicity, with detailed design notes available here. Future analyses aim to benchmark 3FS performance, evaluate bottlenecks, and compare it with other distributed filesystems.\nUpdate on Spain and LALIGA blocks of the internet - Vercel Key Facts Spanish court authorized LALIGA to block IP addresses associated with unauthorized football streaming, affecting Vercel infrastructure since December 2024.

It illustrates configuring a key to run /usr/local/sbin/rrsync -ro /path/ to restrict an SSH session to a read-only rsync operation, enhancing security for database backup transfers. The author demonstrates managing multiple tasks by adding separate SSH keys with different command directives, such as initiating a script to pull database backups from another host. The setup involves specifying the from attribute to restrict access to particular hosts and embedding the command directly within the authorized_keys entry. The approach ensures that each SSH key is tied to a precise, limited operation, preventing unauthorized actions. The article emphasizes the importance of using distinct SSH keys for different tasks, simplifying access management and maintaining security boundaries for critical systems like database backups.\nPython\u0026rsquo;s new t-strings | Dave Peck Key Facts Python 3.14, featuring t-strings, will be released in late 2025 T-strings are a generalization of f-strings, evaluating to string.templatelib.Template objects T-strings improve safety by requiring explicit processing before use, preventing injection vulnerabilities Summary Python\u0026rsquo;s PEP 750 introduces t-strings (template strings) as a new feature in Python 3.14, arriving in late 2025. T-strings extend the capabilities of f-strings by evaluating to string.templatelib.Template objects rather than immediate strings, enabling safer and more flexible string processing. Unlike f-strings, which can be dangerously misused with user input (e.g., SQL injection or XSS), t-strings require explicit processing before conversion to a string, allowing developers to implement safe escaping functions such as html(). T-strings provide access to their components via .strings and .values properties, supporting complex manipulations and custom processing, including iteration and detailed interpolation analysis. They can be instantiated with literal syntax (t\u0026quot;...\u0026quot;) or directly through the Template constructor with Interpolation objects. An example demonstrates converting a template into pig Latin by processing each interpolation. The feature aims to enhance string safety and flexibility in Python libraries and frameworks, especially those handling user input, and is expected to influence tooling support like code formatters and IDEs.\nDefold - Official Homepage - Cross platform game engine Key Facts Defold is a free, production-ready, cross-platform game engine supporting major platforms including PlayStation®5, PlayStation®4, Nintendo Switch, Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, Windows, Steam, HTML5, Facebook, and Q3 2024 XBox.

It presents a structured approach: using @dataclass for attribute management, @classmethod factory methods for object creation, and typing.NewType for enforcing constraints on primitive types. This methodology ensures valid object construction, improves discoverability, and enhances testability without relying on side-effect-laden __init__ methods. Summary The article argues that defining custom __init__ methods in Python classes is an anti-pattern, historically used to facilitate object instantiation with attributes like x and y in data structures such as 2DCoordinate. Prior to Python 3.7\u0026rsquo;s @dataclass, developers resorted to complex alternatives like factory functions or attribute defaults, which had significant drawbacks. Using __init__ for side-effect-laden setup, such as opening file descriptors in a FileReader class, introduces problems including reduced testability, increased complexity, and potential invalid object states. The proposed solution involves leveraging @dataclass to automatically generate attribute assignment, replacing __init__ with @classmethod factory methods (e.g., FileReader.open) for flexible, asynchronous, or context-specific instantiation, and employing typing.NewType to enforce constraints on primitive types like file descriptors. This approach ensures objects are always valid, simplifies testing, and makes object creation more discoverable and future-proof, aligning with Python\u0026rsquo;s idiomatic practices.\nFossil fuels fall below 50% of US electricity for the first month on record | Ember Key Facts In March 2025, fossil fuels accounted for 49.2% of US electricity, the first month below 50%, surpassing the previous record low of 51% in April 2024 Clean energy sources generated 50.8% of US electricity in March 2025, driven by record-high wind and solar power Wind and solar reached a combined 24.4% of US electricity, with solar increasing 37% (+8.3 TWh) and wind increasing 12% (+5.7 TWh) compared to March 2024; total wind and solar generation hit 83 TWh, an 11% rise over April 2024 Summary In March 2025, the US experienced a historic shift as fossil fuels contributed only 49.2% to electricity generation, marking the first month on record below the 50% threshold, according to Ember.

Comptime code executes in the target environment, not on the host machine, preventing host architecture leakage, as demonstrated by examples showing architecture-dependent behavior during cross-compilation. Zig does not support dynamic source code injection or evaluation (#eval), relying instead on partial evaluation and specialization, such as marking function parameters with comptime to generate optimized code paths. It also lacks support for custom syntax DSLs, as all code operates on Zig values, with embedded DSLs like print using format strings. Zig does not include runtime type information (RTTI), requiring users to implement manual reflection for dynamic data handling, exemplified by a custom RTTI union and print_dyn function. Additionally, Zig types cannot be extended with methods post-generation; API modifications are limited to reflection-based internal logic. Finally, Zig’s compile-time evaluation is hermetic, with no I/O capabilities, ensuring reproducibility and safety, though build systems can invoke external programs for code generation.\nmatthewsinclair.com · Intelligence.

Key issues include tariffs being too low to offset higher U.S. production costs, as manufacturing in the U.S. remains more expensive than in Asia even with tariffs. The U.S. supply chain for industrial components is weak, relying heavily on Asian factories, making local production uncompetitive. The country lacks essential manufacturing knowhow, such as moldmaking and semiconductor fabrication, which cannot be quickly or easily developed. Labor costs in the U.S. are higher not only due to wages but also because of lower productivity, work ethic, and infrastructure quality compared to China. Infrastructure deficits, including electricity generation and transportation networks, further hinder manufacturing revival. The lengthy process to build and operationalize new factories (minimum two years) and the uncertainty caused by fluctuating tariffs discourage investment. Complex and inconsistent tariff enforcement, along with a litigious business environment, exacerbate risks. The policy risks causing a recession, as supply chain disruptions and increased costs lead to inflation or deflation. The article predicts that unless policies change, globalization will bypass the U.S., with manufacturing shifting to countries like Vietnam and Mexico. To genuinely rebuild manufacturing, the U.S. must address fundamental social, infrastructural, and educational issues, implement gradual tariff increases, and incentivize high-end production, rather than relying solely on tariffs.\nDecreased CO2 saturation during circular breathwork supports emergence of altered states of consciousness | Communications Psychology Key Facts Circular breathwork induces significant reductions in end-tidal CO2 pressure (etCO2), with active participants reaching levels as low as 10–20 mmHg, compared to 36.7 ± 1.5 mmHg in non-hyperventilating controls Decreases in etCO2 are significantly correlated with the onset and depth of altered states of consciousness (ASCs), resembling psychedelic experiences across domains such as ego dissolution and unity Both Holotropic and Conscious-Connected breathwork produce similar physiological and experiential outcomes, with session durations of approximately 3 hours and 1.5 hours respectively, engaging the same mechanisms Summary This study demonstrates that circular breathwork, involving deliberate hyperventilation, can reliably trigger altered states of consciousness (ASCs) akin to those produced by psychedelics, with experience scales (MEQ30 and 11D-ASC) reaching levels comparable to moderate doses of psilocybin, LSD, and MDMA. Physiologically, active participants exhibited a marked reduction in end-tidal CO2 (etCO2), dropping to as low as 10–20 mmHg, which was strongly associated with ASC onset (r = -0.46 to -0.47, p \u0026lt; 0.01). These reductions in CO2 pressure, supported by prior hyperventilation research, appear to serve as a physiological trigger for ASC emergence, with lower etCO2 levels (\u0026lt;35 mmHg) virtually guaranteeing profound experiences when falling below 20 mmHg. The experiential depth correlated with physiological changes and persisted even as etCO2 levels normalized, suggesting a transition into a neuronal state of heightened perception, consistent with the concept of Pivotal Mental States. Both breathwork styles—Holotropic and Conscious-Connected—elicited similar physiological and subjective effects despite differences in session length, indicating shared underlying mechanisms. Post-session assessments revealed sustained improvements in well-being and reductions in depressive symptoms, with deeper ASC experiences predicting greater long-term benefits. Physiologically, breathwork caused a decrease in salivary alpha-amylase (sympathetic activity marker) and an increase in IL-1β (inflammatory marker), with subjective ASC depth inversely related to inflammation. These findings position breathwork as a non-pharmacological tool capable of inducing profound, psychedelic-like states through physiological modulation, with potential therapeutic applications supported by its safety profile and accessibility.\nSynology Lost the Plot with Hard Drive Locking Move - ServeTheHome Key Facts Synology plans to restrict its 2025 Plus NAS models to use only its own branded hard drives This move disables features like volume-wide deduplication, lifespan analysis, and automatic firmware updates for third-party drives The new policy limits maximum raw capacity to 128TB in an 8-bay NAS, compared to 208TB with competing brands like QNAP and TrueNAS using third-party drives Summary Synology is moving towards vendor-locking its 2025 Plus series NAS devices to only support Synology-branded hard drives, a shift that restricts compatibility with third-party drives and disables features such as volume-wide deduplication, lifespan analysis, and automatic firmware updates for non-branded drives. This strategy appears to be driven by a desire to increase margins, as Synology’s current drives max out at 16TB (e.g., HAT3310-16T), whereas competitors like WD Red Pro and Toshiba N300 Pro offer drives up to 26TB. Locking drives limits data security options, as users cannot quickly replace failed drives with models from other vendors, which can delay rebuild times and compromise data safety. Additionally, long-term availability of Synology drives is uncertain, raising concerns about future replacements and ecosystem dependence. The move is viewed as a step back in hardware flexibility and could harm Synology’s reputation, especially given the aging hardware and limited hardware refresh cycles. Critics argue that this lock-in reduces consumer choice and may lead to higher costs, as Synology’s drives are priced higher and have slower delivery times compared to third-party options. The industry context shows that vendor lock-in strategies often backfire, and many users prefer building custom solutions or switching to open-source NAS platforms like TrueNAS.\n▶️ Technology Try generating video in Gemini, powered by Veo 2 Key Facts Google has introduced video generation features in Gemini, powered by Veo 2, available to Google One AI Premium subscribers.

Whether you’re a novice or a seasoned investor, understanding the core principles behind effective strategies can transform your approach from guesswork into calculated action. This blog post breaks down three high-level themes critical to modern investing: Diversification, Risk-Adjusted Returns, and Behavioral Finance. Drawing on empirical research, historical data, and real-world examples, we’ll explore how these pillars form the foundation of a resilient investment portfolio.\n1. Diversification: The Science of Spreading Risk Like a Quantum Physicist The adage “don’t put all your eggs in one basket” isn’t just folk wisdom—it’s a foundational principle rooted in probability theory and statistical mechanics. Diversification aims to minimize unsystematic risk (specific to individual assets) while maintaining exposure to systematic risk (market-wide factors). Here’s how it works:\nThe Mathematics of Correlation When constructing a portfolio, the key is to combine assets with low or negative correlations. For example, if Stock A plummets during economic downturns but Bond B rises due to lower interest rates, their negative correlation reduces volatility without sacrificing returns (see Figure 1 below).\nAsset Pair Correlation Coefficient Volatility Reduction Stocks \u0026amp; Bonds -0.3 28% Tech \u0026amp; Utilities +0.7 5% Figure 1: Hypothetical correlation effects on portfolio volatility.\nModern Portfolio Theory (MPT): A Nobel Prize-Winning Framework Harry Markowitz’s MPT formalized diversification into a mathematical model. By optimizing the trade-off between expected return and risk (measured by variance), investors can identify an “efficient frontier” of optimal portfolios. The formula: \\[ \\sigma_p = \\sqrt{w_1^2\\sigma_1^2 + w_2^2\\sigma_2^2 + 2w_1w_2\\rho_{1,2}\\sigma_1\\sigma_2} \\] Where \\( w \\) = weights of assets, \\( \\sigma \\) = standard deviations, and \\( \\rho \\) = correlation.\nPractical Diversification Strategies Asset Classes: Allocate across stocks, bonds, commodities, and real estate. Geographic Spread: Invest in developed vs. emerging markets to hedge against regional risks. Sector Rotation: Use ETFs like XLK (Technology) and XLF (Financials) to balance cyclical trends. Case Study: The 2008 Crisis During the financial crisis, investors holding a mix of Treasuries (which rallied) and defensive sectors like healthcare weathered losses better than those in concentrated real estate or banking stocks. Diversification wasn’t just “insurance”—it was a survival mechanism.\n2. Risk-Adjusted Returns: Measuring Success Beyond the Arithmetic of Gains Profitability alone doesn’t define success—risk-adjusted returns separate skilled investors from lucky gamblers. Metrics like Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, and Treynor Ratio quantify how much excess return you’re getting per unit of risk taken. Let’s dive into the details:\nThe Sharpe Ratio: A Standardized Benchmark \\[ \\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \\frac{(R_p - R_f)}{\\sigma_p} \\] Where \\( R_p \\) is portfolio return, \\( R_f \\) is risk-free rate (e.g., U.S. T-bills), and \\( \\sigma_p \\) is standard deviation of returns. A ratio above 1 is generally favorable.\nThe Flaw of Naive Comparisons Two portfolios might both yield 8% annually, but one could have a Sharpe Ratio of 0.5 (high volatility) versus another at 1.2 (low volatility). The latter is objectively superior for risk-averse investors.\nRisk Parity: An Engineer’s Approach to Allocation Instead of weighting assets by capital, risk parity allocates based on volatility contributions. For instance, if stocks have twice the volatility of bonds, they’d receive half their dollar allocation to balance risk exposure. This strategy thrived during the 2018 market selloff when traditional portfolios faltered.\nPractical Takeaways: Use VaR (Value at Risk) models to stress-test portfolios against extreme scenarios. Avoid chasing high returns with no regard for downside potential—volatility is your enemy. 3. Behavioral Finance: The Psychology of Why We Lose Money—and How to Win** Investing is as much a battle against human psychology as it is against market forces. Behavioral finance studies cognitive biases that lead investors astray, offering tools to mitigate irrational decisions. Key concepts include:\nOverconfidence Bias \u0026amp; the “Winner’s Curse” Studies show 74% of investors overestimate their ability to time markets (Barber \u0026amp; Odean, 2016). This leads to frequent trading—often at the wrong times—which erodes returns by ~2-3% annually.\nLoss Aversion: The 2:1 Pain-to-Pleasure Ratio Kahneman and Tversky’s research reveals losses hurt twice as much as gains feel good. This drives decisions like holding losing stocks “until they break even” (the sunk cost fallacy). A disciplined rebalancing schedule combats this bias by enforcing sell/buy rules.\nFOMO (Fear of Missing Out) in a Modern Context During the 2021 GameStop short squeeze, retail traders ignored fundamentals, chasing gains they perceived as “guaranteed.” The result? A 60% drop from peak levels within months.\nTools to Counteract Bias: Automated Rebalancing: Set calendar-based rebalances to avoid emotional timing. Black Box Investing: Use algorithms that ignore sentiment (e.g., momentum strategies). Conclusion: Building a System, Not Chasing Performance** The best portfolios blend rigorous diversification with risk-awareness and behavioral discipline. As Warren Buffett quipped, “Risk comes from not knowing what you’re doing.” By applying these principles, investors transform uncertainty into controlled opportunity—and that’s where true wealth is built.\nStay rational, stay diversified.\n","permalink":"https://alobbs.com/posts/my-first-post/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eInvesting isn’t just about picking stocks—it’s a science of risk, reward, and relentless discipline.
