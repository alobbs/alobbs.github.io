Summary Louis Rossmann\u0026rsquo;s video critiques DJI\u0026rsquo;s business model, revealing that purchasing a DJI camera does not grant ownership of the hardware but instead provides a license to use the camera. This licensing approach implies that users do not own the device outright, but are granted permission to operate it under specific terms. The video emphasizes the technical and legal implications of this model, suggesting it shifts ownership rights and control from consumers to the manufacturer. The discussion underscores broader concerns about proprietary licensing in consumer electronics, where users may face restrictions on repair, modification, or resale. The video\u0026rsquo;s key data points include the date of upload (April 17, 2025), view count (416,986), and the focus on the distinction between hardware ownership and licensing rights in DJI products.\n▶️ Software Development Pipelining might be my favorite programming language feature | MOND←TECH MAGAZINE Key Facts The article advocates for pipelining as a programming language feature that allows passing previous values as arguments, enhancing code readability and editing ease. Pipelining enables method chaining and function composition, exemplified by Rust’s trait-based approach, Haskell’s \u0026amp; and $ operators, and SQL’s pipe syntax. Benefits include improved code discovery, simplified refactoring, better IDE support, and clearer data flow, reducing nested parentheses and complex variable tracking. Summary The article presents pipelining as a highly valued programming language feature that simplifies code structure by passing previous values directly into subsequent functions or methods. It contrasts traditional nested or imperative code with pipelined syntax, emphasizing how the latter improves readability, ease of editing, and IDE support, especially in languages like Rust, Haskell, and SQL. Rust’s trait-based method calls exemplify effective pipelining without requiring higher-kinded types, while Haskell’s \u0026amp; and $ operators demonstrate functional composition that enhances clarity. SQL’s proposed pipe syntax reduces nested queries into linear, line-by-line transformations, aligning with LINQ-style readability. The article also discusses the builder pattern as a form of pipelining for object construction, and critiques Haskell’s complex operator ecosystem, advocating for more approachable, pipeline-friendly syntax. Overall, pipelining is praised for enabling modular, understandable, and maintainable code, with a focus on top-to-bottom data flow and minimal parentheses or variable tracking.\n▶️ Management and Leadership Android phones will soon reboot themselves after sitting unused for 3 days - Ars Technica Key Facts Android devices will automatically reboot after being locked and unused for 3 consecutive days via a Google Play Services update (version 25.14), rolling out gradually from April 14, 2025. The feature enhances security by encrypting data in the \u0026ldquo;Before First Unlock\u0026rdquo; (BFU) state, making data retrieval more difficult, especially after prolonged inactivity. The update is part of a broader set of improvements, including UI enhancements, better connectivity with cars and watches, and content previews in Quick Share. Summary A silent update to Google Play Services (version 25.14), released on April 14, 2025, introduces an auto-restart feature for Android devices, activating after three days of inactivity when the device remains locked. This feature aims to improve security by encrypting all data in the BFU state, where biometrics and location-based unlocking are disabled, and access is limited to PIN or passcode. The automatic reboot makes data extraction significantly more difficult, aligning with similar features like Apple\u0026rsquo;s Inactivity Reboot introduced in iOS 18.1. The update is delivered automatically to certified devices over the next week or more, with no user intervention required. This mechanism leverages Google Play Services\u0026rsquo; background update system, which has been central to Android\u0026rsquo;s system update strategy, allowing Google to enhance security and functionality remotely. The broader update includes UI improvements, enhanced device connectivity, and content sharing features.\nDeciphering Glyph :: Stop Writing __init__ Methods Key Facts The article critiques the widespread use of custom __init__ methods in Python classes, especially before dataclasses (introduced in Python 3.7), highlighting their drawbacks. It presents a structured approach: using @dataclass for attribute management, @classmethod factory methods for object creation, and typing.NewType for enforcing constraints on primitive types. This methodology ensures valid object construction, improves discoverability, and enhances testability without relying on side-effect-laden __init__ methods. Summary The article argues that defining custom __init__ methods in Python classes is an anti-pattern, historically used to facilitate object instantiation with attributes like x and y in data structures such as 2DCoordinate. Prior to Python 3.7\u0026rsquo;s @dataclass, developers resorted to complex alternatives like factory functions or attribute defaults, which had significant drawbacks. Using __init__ for side-effect-laden setup, such as opening file descriptors in a FileReader class, introduces problems including reduced testability, increased complexity, and potential invalid object states. The proposed solution involves leveraging @dataclass to automatically generate attribute assignment, replacing __init__ with @classmethod factory methods (e.g., FileReader.open) for flexible, asynchronous, or context-specific instantiation, and employing typing.NewType to enforce constraints on primitive types like file descriptors. This approach ensures objects are always valid, simplifies testing, and makes object creation more discoverable and future-proof, aligning with Python\u0026rsquo;s idiomatic practices.\nFossil fuels fall below 50% of US electricity for the first month on record | Ember Key Facts In March 2025, fossil fuels accounted for 49.2% of US electricity, the first month below 50%, surpassing the previous record low of 51% in April 2024 Clean energy sources generated 50.8% of US electricity in March 2025, driven by record-high wind and solar power Wind and solar reached a combined 24.4% of US electricity, with solar increasing 37% (+8.3 TWh) and wind increasing 12% (+5.7 TWh) compared to March 2024; total wind and solar generation hit 83 TWh, an 11% rise over April 2024 Summary In March 2025, the US experienced a historic shift as fossil fuels contributed only 49.2% to electricity generation, marking the first month on record below the 50% threshold, according to Ember. This milestone reflects a long-term decline in fossil fuel reliance, with wind and solar power reaching a record 24.4% of the energy mix—solar alone increased by 37% (+8.3 TWh) and wind by 12% (+5.7 TWh) year-over-year. Combined, wind and solar generated 83 TWh, an 11% increase from April 2024, while fossil fuel generation decreased by 2.5% (-4.3 TWh). Since March 2015, when fossil fuels accounted for 65% and solar just 1%, the share of wind and solar has more than quadrupled, with solar expected to constitute over half of new US capacity in 2025. The rapid growth of renewable energy signifies a pivotal transition toward a cleaner power system, with wind and solar increasingly displacing coal and gas, and signals a potential approaching tipping point where clean energy surpasses fossil fuel reliance in the US electricity sector. More details are available at Ember.\nGitHub - LukasOgunfeitimi/TikTok-ReverseEngineering Key Facts The project reverse engineers TikTok\u0026rsquo;s custom virtual machine (VM) used for obfuscation and security. It includes tools for deobfuscating webmssdk.js, decompiling VM bytecode, injecting deobfuscated scripts, and generating signed URLs. Bytecode is stored as a long string XOR-encrypted with a key embedded within the string; decryption involves base64 decoding, XOR with a key derived from the string, and leb128 decoding for compression. Summary The repository provides tools to reverse engineer TikTok\u0026rsquo;s sophisticated VM-based obfuscation system. It deobfuscates heavily encrypted webmssdk.js by reversing bracket notation encoding, replacing function arrays with standard functions, and reconstructing the VM\u0026rsquo;s bytecode execution logic. The bytecode is stored as a long base64-encoded string, XOR-encrypted with an embedded key, and leb128 compressed, which is decoded to extract functions, strings, and metadata. The VM supports scopes, nested functions, and exception handling, indicating a complex, custom bytecode interpreter. Decompilation involves analyzing VM switch-case structures, with manual and AI-assisted efforts to produce readable code snippets. The system also includes a URL signing mechanism that replicates TikTok\u0026rsquo;s request signatures (msToken, X-Bogus, _signature) by executing specific VM functions, enabling authenticated requests such as posting comments. The project emphasizes that TikTok\u0026rsquo;s VM is subject to frequent updates, requiring ongoing reverse engineering efforts. It leverages browser extensions like Tampermonkey and CSP bypasses for debugging and script injection, facilitating real-time analysis and testing.\nGitHub - humanlayer/12-factor-agents: What are the principles we can use to build LLM-powered software that is actually good enough to put in the hands of production customers? Key Facts The project outlines 12 core principles for building reliable, scalable, and maintainable LLM-powered software suitable for production deployment. These principles include owning prompts, controlling context windows, structuring tool outputs, unifying execution and business state, and owning control flow. The guide emphasizes integrating modular concepts from agent design into existing products rather than relying solely on frameworks, to accelerate deployment of high-quality AI features. Summary The \u0026ldquo;12-factor agents\u0026rdquo; framework, inspired by the 12 Factor Apps, provides foundational principles for developing production-ready LLM-powered software. It addresses common challenges such as managing prompts, context windows, structured tool outputs, and control flow, advocating for ownership and modularity in these areas. The approach discourages building from scratch with full frameworks; instead, it recommends incorporating small, modular agent concepts into existing products to improve reliability, scalability, and maintainability. The twelve factors include transforming natural language into tool calls, owning prompts and context, unifying execution and business state, enabling simple APIs for launching and pausing agents, and designing small, focused agents that can trigger from anywhere and act as stateless reducers. The guide also discusses the historical evolution from DAG-based orchestrators to agent loops, highlighting the limitations of purely loop-based agent architectures. It emphasizes that core engineering techniques, rather than frameworks alone, are key to deploying effective AI agents in customer-facing environments. Additional resources and related frameworks are linked throughout, supporting developers in applying these principles across various languages and platforms.\nThings Zig comptime Won\u0026rsquo;t Do Key Facts Zig’s comptime is designed to be restrictive, preventing host architecture leakage, dynamic code evaluation (#eval), DSL creation, RTTI, API extension, and IO operations Comptime code observes the target architecture, not the host, ensuring cross-compilation correctness Zig lacks facilities for dynamic source code generation, custom syntax extension, runtime type information, and input/output during compilation Summary Zig’s compile-time evaluation (comptime) features are intentionally limited to maintain safety, portability, and simplicity. Comptime code executes in the target environment, not on the host machine, preventing host architecture leakage, as demonstrated by examples showing architecture-dependent behavior during cross-compilation. Zig does not support dynamic source code injection or evaluation (#eval), relying instead on partial evaluation and specialization, such as marking function parameters with comptime to generate optimized code paths. It also lacks support for custom syntax DSLs, as all code operates on Zig values, with embedded DSLs like print using format strings. Zig does not include runtime type information (RTTI), requiring users to implement manual reflection for dynamic data handling, exemplified by a custom RTTI union and print_dyn function. Additionally, Zig types cannot be extended with methods post-generation; API modifications are limited to reflection-based internal logic. Finally, Zig’s compile-time evaluation is hermetic, with no I/O capabilities, ensuring reproducibility and safety, though build systems can invoke external programs for code generation.\nmatthewsinclair.com · Intelligence. Innovation. Leadership. Influence. Key Facts Author used Claude Code to develop approximately 30,000 lines of code across backend and frontend projects within weeks AI tools function as amplifiers (\u0026ldquo;mech suit\u0026rdquo;) rather than replacements, requiring human oversight and architectural judgment Vigilance is necessary due to AI\u0026rsquo;s tendency to make bewildering or inappropriate decisions, necessitating constant review and control Summary The article argues that LLM-powered programming tools like Claude Code serve as amplifiers—\u0026ldquo;mech suits\u0026rdquo;—that enhance developer capabilities rather than replace humans. The author built two applications totaling around 30,000 lines of code in weeks, demonstrating significant acceleration in development speed. These tools provide tremendous \u0026ldquo;lifting power,\u0026rdquo; but require developers to maintain constant vigilance, guiding the AI and correcting its often bewildering or biased decisions, similar to piloting an aircraft. The process shifts focus from coding to designing, reviewing, and maintaining architectural integrity, emphasizing the importance of experience and domain knowledge to recognize when AI output is flawed. The author highlights the \u0026ldquo;centaur effect,\u0026rdquo; where human-AI collaboration outperforms either alone, with AI handling pattern recognition and tactical execution, and humans providing strategic oversight. The article stresses that effective use of these tools demands new skills—particularly in delegation, ruthless discarding of suboptimal solutions, and clear problem understanding. While some fear AI will replace programmers, the author sees the future as augmentation, where mastery of AI tools becomes a core skill, transforming the role of developers into strategic operators of powerful systems. The key to success lies in balancing delegation with control, leveraging AI for speed while applying human judgment to ensure quality and direction.\nTLS Certificate Lifetimes Will Officially Reduce to 47 Days | DigiCert Key Facts CA/Browser Forum voted to reduce TLS certificate lifetime to 47 days, with implementation starting March 15, 2026 Maximum TLS certificate validity decreases from 398 days (current) to 200 days (2026), then to 100 days (2027), and finally to 47 days (2029) Reuse period for domain/IP validation info drops from 398 days to 10 days by March 15, 2029; SII reuse in OV/EV certificates reduces from 825 days to 398 days Summary The CA/Browser Forum has officially amended the TLS Baseline Requirements to progressively shorten TLS certificate lifetimes, with the maximum validity decreasing from 398 days to 47 days by March 15, 2029. The schedule begins with a reduction to 200 days in 2026, then to 100 days in 2027, and finally to 47 days in 2029. Concurrently, the reuse period for domain and IP address validation information will decline from 398 days to 10 days, and validation of Subject Identity Information (SII) in OV and EV certificates will be limited to 398 days, down from 825 days. The rationale emphasizes increased trustworthiness of certificate data and mitigates reliance on unreliable revocation systems like CRLs and OCSP. Apple justified the change by highlighting the necessity of automation for managing shorter-lived certificates, with DigiCert supporting this transition through solutions like Trust Lifecycle Manager and CertCentral, including ACME support for automated issuance and renewal. The move aims to enhance security, reduce outages, and promote widespread adoption of automation in certificate management.\nWhy I Cannot Be Technical Key Facts Author asserts she cannot be truly \u0026ldquo;Technical\u0026rdquo; due to structural and social barriers within tech systems \u0026ldquo;Technical\u0026rdquo; is a legitimacy-based, exclusionary label rooted in social hierarchies and identity policing The essay critiques how tech systems perpetuate dehumanization, inequality, and reinforce boundaries based on gender, race, class, and ideology Summary Cat Hicks argues that she cannot genuinely be \u0026ldquo;Technical\u0026rdquo; because the label functions as a structural designation that enforces legitimacy through social exclusion, rather than problem-solving ability. She emphasizes that \u0026ldquo;Technical\u0026rdquo; operates outside of actual problem-solving, serving to uphold hierarchies, policing boundaries, and perpetuating systemic inequalities based on gender, race, class, and social location. Hicks highlights how the social and political context of tech creates unearned privileges and unwarranted exclusions, making it impossible for her to be recognized as legitimate within that framework despite her expertise in psychology and her impactful work. She critiques the hierarchical, hierarchical, and geo-located nature of tech, which maintains a culture of dehumanization and marginalization of those deemed \u0026ldquo;not-Technical.\u0026rdquo; Hicks advocates for recognizing the full humanity of all individuals, emphasizing that true work involves caring, safety, and community rather than perpetuating the \u0026ldquo;hamster wheel\u0026rdquo; of performance and exclusion. She calls for a space of rehumanization and honest conversation about the systemic issues within tech, emphasizing that \u0026ldquo;Technical\u0026rdquo; is a social construct that cannot be earned or bestowed but is maintained through systemic reinforcement. Hicks urges a focus on collective healing, shared storytelling, and challenging the structural barriers that devalue human connection in technology.\nAmerica Underestimates the Difficulty of Bringing Manufacturing Back — Molson Hart Key Facts President announced tariffs on imports ranging from 10% to 49% on April 2, 2025, aiming to revive U.S. manufacturing The article presents 14 reasons why these tariffs will not succeed in bringing manufacturing back and may worsen economic decline Expert with 15 years in manufacturing argues that tariffs are insufficient due to supply chain weaknesses, high costs, lack of knowhow, infrastructure deficits, and complex policy environment Summary The April 2025 U.S. tariff policy, imposing import taxes between 10% and 49%, aims to restore domestic manufacturing but is fundamentally flawed. Key issues include tariffs being too low to offset higher U.S. production costs, as manufacturing in the U.S. remains more expensive than in Asia even with tariffs. The U.S. supply chain for industrial components is weak, relying heavily on Asian factories, making local production uncompetitive. The country lacks essential manufacturing knowhow, such as moldmaking and semiconductor fabrication, which cannot be quickly or easily developed. Labor costs in the U.S. are higher not only due to wages but also because of lower productivity, work ethic, and infrastructure quality compared to China. Infrastructure deficits, including electricity generation and transportation networks, further hinder manufacturing revival. The lengthy process to build and operationalize new factories (minimum two years) and the uncertainty caused by fluctuating tariffs discourage investment. Complex and inconsistent tariff enforcement, along with a litigious business environment, exacerbate risks. The policy risks causing a recession, as supply chain disruptions and increased costs lead to inflation or deflation. The article predicts that unless policies change, globalization will bypass the U.S., with manufacturing shifting to countries like Vietnam and Mexico. To genuinely rebuild manufacturing, the U.S. must address fundamental social, infrastructural, and educational issues, implement gradual tariff increases, and incentivize high-end production, rather than relying solely on tariffs.\nDecreased CO2 saturation during circular breathwork supports emergence of altered states of consciousness | Communications Psychology Key Facts Circular breathwork induces significant reductions in end-tidal CO2 pressure (etCO2), with active participants reaching levels as low as 10–20 mmHg, compared to 36.7 ± 1.5 mmHg in non-hyperventilating controls Decreases in etCO2 are significantly correlated with the onset and depth of altered states of consciousness (ASCs), resembling psychedelic experiences across domains such as ego dissolution and unity Both Holotropic and Conscious-Connected breathwork produce similar physiological and experiential outcomes, with session durations of approximately 3 hours and 1.5 hours respectively, engaging the same mechanisms Summary This study demonstrates that circular breathwork, involving deliberate hyperventilation, can reliably trigger altered states of consciousness (ASCs) akin to those produced by psychedelics, with experience scales (MEQ30 and 11D-ASC) reaching levels comparable to moderate doses of psilocybin, LSD, and MDMA. Physiologically, active participants exhibited a marked reduction in end-tidal CO2 (etCO2), dropping to as low as 10–20 mmHg, which was strongly associated with ASC onset (r = -0.46 to -0.47, p \u0026lt; 0.01). These reductions in CO2 pressure, supported by prior hyperventilation research, appear to serve as a physiological trigger for ASC emergence, with lower etCO2 levels (\u0026lt;35 mmHg) virtually guaranteeing profound experiences when falling below 20 mmHg. The experiential depth correlated with physiological changes and persisted even as etCO2 levels normalized, suggesting a transition into a neuronal state of heightened perception, consistent with the concept of Pivotal Mental States. Both breathwork styles—Holotropic and Conscious-Connected—elicited similar physiological and subjective effects despite differences in session length, indicating shared underlying mechanisms. Post-session assessments revealed sustained improvements in well-being and reductions in depressive symptoms, with deeper ASC experiences predicting greater long-term benefits. Physiologically, breathwork caused a decrease in salivary alpha-amylase (sympathetic activity marker) and an increase in IL-1β (inflammatory marker), with subjective ASC depth inversely related to inflammation. These findings position breathwork as a non-pharmacological tool capable of inducing profound, psychedelic-like states through physiological modulation, with potential therapeutic applications supported by its safety profile and accessibility.\nSynology Lost the Plot with Hard Drive Locking Move - ServeTheHome Key Facts Synology plans to restrict its 2025 Plus NAS models to use only its own branded hard drives This move disables features like volume-wide deduplication, lifespan analysis, and automatic firmware updates for third-party drives The new policy limits maximum raw capacity to 128TB in an 8-bay NAS, compared to 208TB with competing brands like QNAP and TrueNAS using third-party drives Summary Synology is moving towards vendor-locking its 2025 Plus series NAS devices to only support Synology-branded hard drives, a shift that restricts compatibility with third-party drives and disables features such as volume-wide deduplication, lifespan analysis, and automatic firmware updates for non-branded drives. This strategy appears to be driven by a desire to increase margins, as Synology’s current drives max out at 16TB (e.g., HAT3310-16T), whereas competitors like WD Red Pro and Toshiba N300 Pro offer drives up to 26TB. Locking drives limits data security options, as users cannot quickly replace failed drives with models from other vendors, which can delay rebuild times and compromise data safety. Additionally, long-term availability of Synology drives is uncertain, raising concerns about future replacements and ecosystem dependence. The move is viewed as a step back in hardware flexibility and could harm Synology’s reputation, especially given the aging hardware and limited hardware refresh cycles. Critics argue that this lock-in reduces consumer choice and may lead to higher costs, as Synology’s drives are priced higher and have slower delivery times compared to third-party options. The industry context shows that vendor lock-in strategies often backfire, and many users prefer building custom solutions or switching to open-source NAS platforms like TrueNAS.\n▶️ Technology Try generating video in Gemini, powered by Veo 2 Key Facts Google has introduced video generation features in Gemini, powered by Veo 2, available to Google One AI Premium subscribers.

Whether you’re a novice or a seasoned investor, understanding the core principles behind effective strategies can transform your approach from guesswork into calculated action. This blog post breaks down three high-level themes critical to modern investing: Diversification, Risk-Adjusted Returns, and Behavioral Finance. Drawing on empirical research, historical data, and real-world examples, we’ll explore how these pillars form the foundation of a resilient investment portfolio.\n1. Diversification: The Science of Spreading Risk Like a Quantum Physicist The adage “don’t put all your eggs in one basket” isn’t just folk wisdom—it’s a foundational principle rooted in probability theory and statistical mechanics. Diversification aims to minimize unsystematic risk (specific to individual assets) while maintaining exposure to systematic risk (market-wide factors). Here’s how it works:\nThe Mathematics of Correlation When constructing a portfolio, the key is to combine assets with low or negative correlations. For example, if Stock A plummets during economic downturns but Bond B rises due to lower interest rates, their negative correlation reduces volatility without sacrificing returns (see Figure 1 below).\nAsset Pair Correlation Coefficient Volatility Reduction Stocks \u0026amp; Bonds -0.3 28% Tech \u0026amp; Utilities +0.7 5% Figure 1: Hypothetical correlation effects on portfolio volatility.\nModern Portfolio Theory (MPT): A Nobel Prize-Winning Framework Harry Markowitz’s MPT formalized diversification into a mathematical model. By optimizing the trade-off between expected return and risk (measured by variance), investors can identify an “efficient frontier” of optimal portfolios. The formula: \\[ \\sigma_p = \\sqrt{w_1^2\\sigma_1^2 + w_2^2\\sigma_2^2 + 2w_1w_2\\rho_{1,2}\\sigma_1\\sigma_2} \\] Where \\( w \\) = weights of assets, \\( \\sigma \\) = standard deviations, and \\( \\rho \\) = correlation.\nPractical Diversification Strategies Asset Classes: Allocate across stocks, bonds, commodities, and real estate. Geographic Spread: Invest in developed vs. emerging markets to hedge against regional risks. Sector Rotation: Use ETFs like XLK (Technology) and XLF (Financials) to balance cyclical trends. Case Study: The 2008 Crisis During the financial crisis, investors holding a mix of Treasuries (which rallied) and defensive sectors like healthcare weathered losses better than those in concentrated real estate or banking stocks. Diversification wasn’t just “insurance”—it was a survival mechanism.\n2. Risk-Adjusted Returns: Measuring Success Beyond the Arithmetic of Gains Profitability alone doesn’t define success—risk-adjusted returns separate skilled investors from lucky gamblers. Metrics like Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, and Treynor Ratio quantify how much excess return you’re getting per unit of risk taken. Let’s dive into the details:\nThe Sharpe Ratio: A Standardized Benchmark \\[ \\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \\frac{(R_p - R_f)}{\\sigma_p} \\] Where \\( R_p \\) is portfolio return, \\( R_f \\) is risk-free rate (e.g., U.S. T-bills), and \\( \\sigma_p \\) is standard deviation of returns. A ratio above 1 is generally favorable.\nThe Flaw of Naive Comparisons Two portfolios might both yield 8% annually, but one could have a Sharpe Ratio of 0.5 (high volatility) versus another at 1.2 (low volatility). The latter is objectively superior for risk-averse investors.\nRisk Parity: An Engineer’s Approach to Allocation Instead of weighting assets by capital, risk parity allocates based on volatility contributions. For instance, if stocks have twice the volatility of bonds, they’d receive half their dollar allocation to balance risk exposure. This strategy thrived during the 2018 market selloff when traditional portfolios faltered.\nPractical Takeaways: Use VaR (Value at Risk) models to stress-test portfolios against extreme scenarios. Avoid chasing high returns with no regard for downside potential—volatility is your enemy. 3. Behavioral Finance: The Psychology of Why We Lose Money—and How to Win** Investing is as much a battle against human psychology as it is against market forces. Behavioral finance studies cognitive biases that lead investors astray, offering tools to mitigate irrational decisions. Key concepts include:\nOverconfidence Bias \u0026amp; the “Winner’s Curse” Studies show 74% of investors overestimate their ability to time markets (Barber \u0026amp; Odean, 2016).
