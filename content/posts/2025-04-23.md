### [Ex-OpenAI staff and top AI experts seek to block proposed for-profit restructure](https://t.co/xnU6Dx8DFk)
### Key Facts
* Ex-OpenAI employees and leading AI experts, including Geoffrey Hinton, Margaret Mitchell, and Stuart Russell, oppose the company's proposed transition from a non-profit to a for-profit public benefit corporation (PBC).
* The joint letter to California and Delaware attorneys-general warns that the restructuring would transfer control of artificial general intelligence (AGI) development to a profit-driven entity, contradicting OpenAI’s founding mission to benefit all humanity.
* OpenAI aims to complete the for-profit conversion by the end of 2023 to secure additional investments, including a $30bn funding round from SoftBank, amid concerns that the change could undermine its mission and increase societal risks associated with AGI.

### Summary
Former OpenAI staff and top AI researchers, including Geoffrey Hinton and Stuart Russell, have petitioned US authorities to block the company's plan to convert from a non-profit to a for-profit public benefit corporation (PBC). They argue this shift would prioritize profit over the company's original mission to ensure AGI benefits all humanity, risking increased societal and safety concerns. OpenAI, valued at $300bn and seeking to secure further investments, contends that the restructuring will strengthen its non-profit and align with its mission, but critics warn it could lead to loss of control over AGI development and heightened risks of misuse.

### [Native visionOS platform support by rsanchezsaez · Pull Request #105628 · godotengine/godot · GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/105628)
### Key Facts
* This PR adds native support for the visionOS platform to Godot, using iOS as the base and reusing code via `drivers/apple_embedded`.
* Implements platform-specific logic, including app instantiation, display server, and export plugin, with no OpenGL support due to visionOS limitations.
* Renames export plugin files and shared configuration to accommodate both iOS and visionOS, and moves shared code into `drivers/apple_embedded`.
* Tests confirm native execution on visionOS with Metal renderer; DPI metrics are hardcoded, and icon asset support is pending.
* The PR is part of a three-step plan, with subsequent PRs planned for SwiftUI integration and immersive VR plugin support.

### Summary
This PR introduces a native `visionOS` platform support for Godot, closely aligned with the existing iOS implementation. It refactors shared code into `drivers/apple_embedded`, renames relevant export and platform files, and disables OpenGL due to visionOS constraints. Testing with the Platformer demo confirms native execution using Metal, though DPI metrics are static and icon asset generation is incomplete. The contribution lays the groundwork for future immersive VR support and SwiftUI integration, with ongoing discussions about platform maintenance and compatibility considerations.
