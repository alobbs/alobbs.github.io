### [Botnet Part 2: The Web is Broken - Jan Wildeboer’s Blog](https://jan.wildeboer.net/2025/04/Web-is-Broken-Botnet-Part-2/)
### Key Facts
* Companies inject SDKs into iOS, Android, MacOS, and Windows apps to monetize network bandwidth, creating botnets used for web crawling, brute-force attacks, and other malicious activities.
* Infatica is one such company offering access to millions of residential, static, and mobile IP addresses via SDKs embedded in third-party apps.
* Trend Micro's 2023 research confirms malicious actors repackaging freeware to conduct drive-by downloads of services like Infatica, fueling abusive web scraping.
* The business model enables the sale of network access through infected devices, contributing to the explosion of bot traffic that hampers small web services.
* The author advocates that all web scraping should be considered abusive and recommends blocking such traffic to protect web infrastructure.

### Summary
The article highlights the rise of shady business practices where companies recruit app developers to embed SDKs into mobile and desktop applications, monetizing users' network bandwidth to create large-scale botnets. These botnets are used for aggressive web crawling, AI training data collection, and malicious activities, often causing DDoS-like traffic surges that overwhelm small web servers. Infatica, among other providers, offers access to millions of residential, static, and mobile IP addresses, claiming to carefully monitor command execution within infected apps, though the business model is inherently questionable.

Research by Trend Micro in 2023 supports concerns about malicious actors repacking freeware to facilitate drive-by downloads of such proxy services, exacerbating the problem. The widespread use of SDKs that infect user devices and generate illegitimate traffic makes it difficult for users and administrators to detect and block these activities.

### [Python's new t-strings | Dave Peck](https://davepeck.org/2025/04/11/pythons-new-t-strings/)
### Key Facts
* Python 3.14 will officially include [t-strings](https://peps.python.org/pep-0750/) in late 2025
* T-strings are a generalization of f-strings, evaluating to `string.templatelib.Template` objects
* Templates must be processed before use; `str()` on a Template does not return the template content
* `Template` objects provide `.strings` and `.values` properties as tuples, with one more string than value
* Developers can access detailed interpolation info via `.interpolations`, including `value`, `expression`, `conversion`, and `format_spec`

### Summary
Python's upcoming [version 3.14](https://peps.python.org/pep-0750/) will introduce [t-strings](https://davepeck.org/2025/04/11/pythons-new-t-strings/), a new string templating feature that enhances safety and flexibility in string processing. Unlike f-strings, which are immediately evaluated into strings, t-strings evaluate to `string.templatelib.Template` objects that require explicit processing before use, enabling safer handling of user input and dynamic content.

Templates expose `.strings` and `.values` properties as tuples, with `.strings` containing the literal parts and `.values` holding interpolated expressions. Developers can also access detailed interpolation data through `.interpolations`, including the raw expression, conversion flags, and format specifications. T-strings support both literal (`t"foo"`) and programmatic instantiation via the `Template` constructor, which accepts strings and `Interpolation` objects in any order. The feature aims to improve string safety, especially in contexts like HTML and SQL, and is expected to influence library and framework development, with tooling support anticipated in formatters and IDEs.

### [15,000 lines of verified cryptography now in Python | Jonathan Protzenko](https://jonathan.protzenko.fr/2025/04/18/python.html)
### Key Facts
* Python's hash and HMAC algorithms are now fully implemented using [HACL*](https://github.com/project-everest/hacl-star/), a verified cryptographic library, replacing previous implementations.
* The transition involved integrating approximately 15,000 lines of verified C code into Python's repository, with automated updates from upstream HACL*.
* The update enhances support for additional modes in Blake2, a new API for all Keccak variants of SHA3, and improved error management, including handling allocation failures.
* The work spanned 2.5 years, involving contributions from developers Aymeric Fromherz, Son Ho, Gregory P. Smith, Bénédikt Tran, and Chris Eibl, supported by the Python and cryptographic communities.
* The implementation addresses complex streaming API requirements for block algorithms, ensuring safe, generic, and verified handling of various cryptographic modes and states, including optimized HMAC with dual hash states.
### Summary
In November 2022, Jonathan Protzenko proposed replacing Python’s hash infrastructure with verified cryptography after a CVE in SHA3. As of April 2025, Python now vendors [HACL*](https://github.com/project-everest/hacl-star/), a verified cryptographic library, for all default hash and HMAC algorithms, integrating 15,000 lines of verified C code. This transition was seamless for users and involved automating updates from upstream HACL*.

The integration required extensive technical work, including implementing new features such as additional Blake2 modes, a comprehensive SHA3 API covering all Keccak variants, and robust error handling, notably for memory allocation failures. The process involved developing a generic, formally verified streaming API for block algorithms using dependent types, accommodating diverse algorithm-specific requirements like pre-input data, variable output lengths, and state retention.

Handling build complexities, especially with platform-specific optimizations like AVX2 instructions, necessitated refactoring C code to use abstract structs, which was complicated by the auto-generated nature of the code from F* via krml. The project also incorporated rigorous CI testing across 50+ toolchains and architectures, revealing and addressing corner cases such as AVX2-dependent code in HMAC.

Memory failure propagation was achieved by integrating `option` types into the verification model, enabling failure detection and propagation through the cryptographic stack. Upstream updates from HACL* are now manageable via a shell script, simplifying maintenance.

This large-scale integration demonstrates that verified cryptography is mature enough for production use, providing enhanced security guarantees while meeting engineering standards in a major software project like Python.

### [Deciphering Glyph :: Stop Writing `__init__` Methods](https://blog.glyph.im/2025/04/stop-writing-init-methods.html)
### Key Facts
* The article critiques the traditional use of `__init__` methods in Python classes, especially for data structures, highlighting their drawbacks.
* Before Python 3.7, `__init__` was essential for constructing data classes, but alternatives had significant limitations.
* Overusing `__init__` for side-effects or complex initialization links object creation with side-effects, leading to design issues.
* The proposed solution involves using `@dataclass`, `@classmethod` factory methods, and `typing.NewType` for better design.
* Implementing these techniques improves code robustness, testability, discoverability, and future-proofing.

### Summary
The article argues that writing custom `__init__` methods for data classes in Python introduces unnecessary complexity and side-effects, especially when handling more complex data structures like a `FileReader`. Historically, `__init__` was necessary before Python 3.7's introduction of `dataclasses`, but its overuse often leads to tightly coupled object creation and side-effects, complicating testing and maintenance. For example, a `FileReader` class that opens a file descriptor in `__init__` becomes difficult to extend or modify, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations or external dependencies.

The author advocates replacing `__init__` with `@dataclass` for attribute management, `@classmethod` factory methods for flexible object creation, and `typing.NewType` to enforce constraints on primitive types like `int`. This approach ensures objects are always valid upon creation, simplifies testing, and enhances discoverability of construction methods. For instance, `FileReader.open()` as a class method replaces direct constructor calls, allowing for asynchronous or alternative instantiation patterns without side-effects in `__init__`.

By adopting these patterns, developers can create robust, flexible, and future-proof classes that avoid the pitfalls of arbitrary code execution during object instantiation, leading to clearer, more maintainable, and testable codebases.

### [Steve Blank How the U.S. Became A Science Superpower](https://steveblank.com/2025/04/15/how-the-u-s-became-a-science-superpower/)
### Key Facts
* Prior to WWII, the U.S. was a distant second in science and engineering; by war's end, it surpassed Britain and led the world for 85 years.
* British wartime science efforts focused on defense and intelligence tech, led by Professor Frederick Lindemann, with centralized government labs and no university involvement.
* U.S. wartime research was driven by Vannevar Bush, who established university-based, civilian-run labs through the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), funding $9 billion (2025 dollars) from 1941-1945.
* U.S. government funding post-WWII, notably via NSF, NASA, and DARPA, fostered a decentralized, collaborative innovation ecosystem centered around universities like MIT, Harvard, and Stanford.
* Britain’s post-war austerity and economic policies hindered scaling and commercialization of wartime innovations; the U.S. built a global leadership in science, technology, and industry, with university-industry-government partnerships fueling Silicon Valley and related sectors.
* In 2025, U.S. government support for university research declines, raising concerns about future global technological leadership.

### Summary
Before WWII, the U.S. lagged behind Britain in science and engineering, but the war catalyzed a transformation driven by contrasting approaches to research and development. Britain’s wartime efforts, led by Professor Lindemann, relied on centralized government labs focused on defense and intelligence projects, with minimal university involvement. Their approach prioritized short-term survival amid daily bombings and economic constraints, resulting in significant breakthroughs like radar, sonar, and early computing, but lacked the scale and commercialization needed for post-war dominance.

In contrast, the U.S. under Vannevar Bush adopted a decentralized, university-centered model, creating civilian-run labs funded with $9 billion during the war. This fostered a collaborative ecosystem where universities like MIT, Harvard, and Stanford became innovation hubs, supported by large federal investments such as the NSF, NASA, and DARPA. This system enabled rapid development and commercialization of technologies like computers, nuclear power, and synthetic fibers, fueling economic growth and establishing U.S. global leadership.

Post-war, Britain’s economic austerity and political shifts limited its capacity to scale innovations, while the U.S. built a robust, industry-integrated research infrastructure. The indirect cost reimbursement system allowed U.S. universities to develop world-class labs, attracting global talent and generating thousands of startups annually. This university-government-industry partnership became the foundation of Silicon Valley and other high-tech sectors.

Today, China has invested heavily to surpass U.S. technological dominance, and concerns grow as U.S. federal support for university research diminishes in 2025, potentially ending decades of American leadership in science and technology.

### [Decreased CO2 saturation during circular breathwork supports emergence of altered states of consciousness | Communications Psychology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44271-025-00247-0)
### Key Facts
* Study tracked physiological and experiential dynamics during circular breathwork (Holotropic and Conscious-Connected) in 61 experienced practitioners.
* End-tidal CO2 pressure (etCO2) decreased significantly in active-breathing groups, reaching levels below 20 mmHg, correlating with onset of altered states of consciousness (ASCs).
* Subjective ASC scores (MEQ-30 and 11D-ASC) during breathwork resembled those induced by psychedelics, with depth predicting improvements in well-being and reductions in depressive symptoms.
* Physiological changes included a significant drop in etCO2 during active breathwork, with trajectories highly similar across breathwork styles; reductions in CO2 were strongly linked to deeper ASCs.
* Post-session, active breathers showed decreased salivary α-amylase (sympathetic activity marker) and increased IL-1β (inflammatory marker), with subjective ASC depth moderating inflammation; follow-up assessments indicated improved mental health and well-being.

### Summary
This study investigated the physiological and psychological mechanisms underlying circular breathwork, comparing Holotropic and Conscious-Connected techniques in 61 experienced practitioners. Results demonstrated that deliberate hyperventilation during active breathwork led to a significant reduction in end-tidal CO2 (etCO2), often below 20 mmHg, which was strongly associated with the emergence of altered states of consciousness (ASCs). These subjective experiences, measured via the MEQ-30 and 11D-ASC questionnaires, closely resembled psychedelic-induced ASCs, including ego dissolution and unity, and their intensity predicted subsequent improvements in mental health, such as decreased depressive symptoms and enhanced well-being.

Physiologically, active breathers showed a rapid decline in etCO2 during the session, with trajectories highly similar across both breathwork styles, indicating engagement of shared mechanisms. The depth of subjective ASC experiences correlated inversely with etCO2 levels, suggesting that CO2 reduction acts as a trigger for ASC onset. Post-session, biomarkers reflected a complex physiological response: a significant decrease in salivary α-amylase indicated reduced sympathetic activity, while IL-1β levels increased, with deeper ASCs associated with smaller inflammatory responses. These findings support the concept that physiological boundary conditions, notably CO2 depletion, facilitate ASC emergence in a non-pharmacological context, with subjective experience influencing long-term psychological and physiological outcomes.

The similarity in outcomes across both breathwork styles, despite differences in session duration, suggests that core physiological mechanisms—particularly CO2 modulation—are central to ASC induction. The results position circular breathwork as a potentially accessible therapeutic tool capable of eliciting psychedelic-like states, with implications for mental health treatment, especially where pharmacological interventions are restricted. Limitations include the reliance on experienced practitioners and the need for further research into long-term effects, safety, and the role of contextual factors such as set and setting.

### [Synology Lost the Plot with Hard Drive Locking Move - ServeTheHome](https://www.servethehome.com/synology-lost-the-plot-with-hard-drive-locking-move/)
### Key Facts
* Synology plans to restrict its 2025 Plus NAS models to using only Synology-branded hard drives
* This move enforces vendor lock-in, disabling features like volume-wide deduplication, lifespan analysis, and automatic firmware updates for third-party drives
* Synology’s Plus series currently supports drives up to 16TB (e.g., HAT3310-16T), whereas competitors like WD Red Pro support 26TB
* The restriction limits raw capacity to 128TB in an 8-bay NAS, compared to 208TB with other brands
* The move is viewed as a margin-boosting strategy that negatively impacts customer flexibility, data security, and long-term drive availability

### Summary
Synology is reportedly moving towards locking its upcoming 2025 Plus NAS models to only support its own branded hard drives, as reported by [HardwareLuxx](https://www.hardwareluxx.de/index.php/news/hardware/festplatten/65949-synology-weitet-den-zwang-zur-eignen-oder-zertifizierten-festplatte-auf-die-plus-modelle-aus.html). This change will disable key features such as volume-wide deduplication, lifespan analysis, and automatic firmware updates for third-party drives, effectively forcing users to buy Synology-branded drives. Currently, the Plus series supports drives up to 16TB, with the maximum raw capacity of an 8-bay NAS being 128TB, whereas competitors like WD Red Pro offer 26TB drives and a total capacity of 208TB in similar configurations.

The move appears to be a strategy to increase margins by rebranding drives from other manufacturers, which is criticized as detrimental to customer choice and data security. Vendor lock-in complicates drive replacement, especially when drives fail or need upgrading, and raises concerns about long-term availability and support. The restriction limits the ability to use drives from other vendors, which are often more readily available and have larger capacities, thus reducing flexibility and increasing dependency on Synology’s supply chain. Critics argue this approach is a step back from previous hardware standards and could harm Synology’s reputation, as many users prefer open hardware configurations like [TrueNAS](https://www.servethehome.com/category/server-parts/server-systems/) or custom-built solutions.

### Summary
Google has introduced Gemini 2.5 Flash in early preview, available through the [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/thinking) via [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat?model=gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17), [Vertex AI](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/studio/multimodal?model=gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17), and the Gemini app. Building on Gemini 2.0 Flash, this version significantly enhances reasoning capabilities while preserving speed and cost efficiency. It is the first fully hybrid reasoning model, enabling developers to toggle "thinking" on or off and set reasoning budgets to balance quality, latency, and cost.

The model performs multi-step reasoning tasks, such as solving math problems or analyzing complex prompts, with improved accuracy. It supports adjustable reasoning token budgets from 0 to 24,576 tokens, allowing fine-grained control over the reasoning process. Developers can specify a reasoning budget via API parameters or UI sliders, with the model automatically adjusting reasoning depth based on prompt complexity. Gemini 2.5 Flash demonstrates strong performance on challenging prompts, ranking second only to Gemini 2.5 Pro on the LMArena benchmark, and offers a superior price-to-performance ratio. The model's API and detailed reasoning guides are available in the [developer documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/thinking#set-budget).
