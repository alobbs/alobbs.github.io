### [Recent Findings Confirm LLMs Can't Achieve AGI Anytime Soon](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/the-last-few-months-have-been-devastating)
Recent developments disprove LLMs as near-AGI solutions, with key papers and expert opinions confirming they cannot overcome core reasoning and distribution challenges, delaying AGI by at least a decade.

* Recent months have discredited the idea that LLMs can achieve AGI, citing failures in reasoning, distribution shift, and overhyped claims.
* June 2025: Apple’s reasoning paper confirmed LLMs cannot handle distribution shift; August 2025: GPT-5 underperformed; September 2025: Rich Sutton acknowledged limitations of LLMs; October 2025: Andrej Karpathy and Demis Hassabis emphasized AGI is at least a decade away.
* Experts agree current paradigm of LLMs is insufficient for AGI, with research indicating formal reasoning and understanding remain significant hurdles.
