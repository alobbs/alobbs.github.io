### [Oracle Java Audits Surge Ahead of Year-End Amid Cost Concerns](https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/09/users_advised_to_review_oracle_java_use/)
Oracle Java audits are increasing globally ahead of fiscal year-end, as the shift to a per-employee license model raises costs up to fivefold, prompting many companies to consider open-source alternatives.

* Experts warn of increased Oracle Java audits as year-end approaches, driven by a shift to a per-employee licensing model that can increase costs by up to five times.
* Oracle introduced paid Java subscriptions in September 2018 and switched to a per-employee pricing model in January 2023, causing price hikes of 2-5x for users.
* Azul CEO Scott Sellers reports a global rise in audits and Java sales teams targeting companies downloading Java, with many contracts expiring at the end of May prompting reconsideration of Oracle licensing.
* Azul launched JVM Inventory for runtime visibility; a 2025 Dimensional Research report shows 88% of Java users consider switching to open-source JVMs, up from 72% in 2023.
* Industry experts advise organizations to prepare early for potential license issues, consider moving off Oracle Java, and avoid returning Oracle audit calls, which are often aggressive.

### [ALICE Detects Lead to Gold Transmutation at CERN’s LHC](https://www.home.cern/news/news/physics/alice-detects-conversion-lead-gold-lhc)
ALICE measured lead-to-gold transmutation via electromagnetic dissociation during LHC lead–lead collisions, producing up to 89,000 gold nuclei/sec, confirming nuclear transmutation through photon–nucleus interactions.

* ALICE collaboration measured the transmutation of lead into gold via near-miss lead–lead collisions at CERN’s LHC, published in [Physical Review C](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevC.111.054906) on May 8, 2025
* Gold nuclei produced at a maximum rate of approximately 89,000 nuclei per second during Run 2 (2015–2018), totaling about 86 billion nuclei, equivalent to 29 picograms
* The process involves electromagnetic dissociation where high-energy electromagnetic fields induce photon–nucleus interactions, ejecting protons and neutrons; three protons are removed from lead to produce gold (79 protons)
* Lead nuclei, containing 82 protons, travel at 99.999993% of light speed, creating intense electromagnetic fields that generate short-lived photon pulses capable of inducing nuclear transmutation
* Gold nuclei emerge with high energy, fragmenting immediately upon hitting beam pipe or collimators; their production demonstrates electromagnetic nuclear transmutation at collider energies
