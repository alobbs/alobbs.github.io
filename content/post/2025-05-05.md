### [Wireless USB Standards Fail to Achieve High-Speed Connectivity](http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2025/05/what-went-wrong-with-wireless-usb.html)
Wireless USB's competing standards and hardware limitations led to market failure; existing Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technologies ultimately fulfilled WPAN needs, while UWB remains useful for location-based applications.

* Wireless USB standards emerged in early 2000s with competing protocols: WiMedia's MB-OFDM and DS-UWB, approved by FCC in 2002
* Both standards were incompatible; MB-OFDM backed by Intel and others, DS-UWB led by Motorola; standards disputes caused fragmentation
* Wireless USB devices like Belkin's Cable-Free USB and Gefen's Wireless USB Extender demonstrated in 2006-2007 but failed commercially; hardware was limited, speeds far below USB 2.0
* The WiMedia Alliance merged standards into ECMA-368 in 2005; development stalled, and the UWB Forum disbanded in 2007
* Proprietary implementations, such as Atlona's CW-USB and Gefen's WiRanger, used 802.11g Wi-Fi or proprietary chips, limited to low bandwidth and insecure encryption (WEP)
* Wireless USB's promise of high-speed, cableless connectivity was never realized; practical speeds remained slow (e.g., 13 KB/sec in tests), range limited, and compatibility issues persisted
* The concept was largely abandoned by 2008, replaced by Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other existing wireless standards that exceeded UWB's capabilities
* UWB technology persists today in location tracking and precise positioning (e.g., Apple U1 chips, NFL tracking, autonomous vehicles), but not as a high-bandwidth WPAN solution
