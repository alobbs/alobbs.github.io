### [Telefonica Falsely Claimed Domain Block and Suppressed CUII Transparency](https://lina.sh/blog/telefonica-sabotages-me)
Telefonica altered their DNS responses in February 2025 to falsely claim their own domain was blocked by CUII, then stopped redirecting blocked sites to `notice.cuii.info`, impairing transparency.

* In February 2025, Telefonica modified their DNS servers to falsely indicate `blau-sicherheit.info` was blocked by the CUII, despite it being their own domain.
* Two hours after the DNS change, the author’s website detected that Telefonica had altered DNS responses to stop redirecting blocked domains to `notice.cuii.info`, making blocked sites appear nonexistent.
* The DNS response manipulation aimed to hinder detection of CUII blocking, coinciding with Netzpolitik.org’s exposure of the CUII’s recent errors, suggesting intentional sabotage to reduce transparency.

### [The Evolution of Bug Bounty Programs: From Netscape to AI-Driven Security](https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/24/bug_bounty_advice/)
Bug bounty programs, initiated by Netscape, have evolved into complex systems using in-house and platform-based models, with AI increasing report volume but raising quality concerns.

* Bug bounty programs originated with Netscape 30 years ago and have since expanded across commercial and government sectors with varied effectiveness.
* Early programs faced legal risks; Microsoft, Google, and Facebook adopted structured bounty initiatives from 2010 onward, often outsourcing to platforms like HackerOne and Bugcrowd.
* Large organizations prefer in-house programs for high-sensitivity bugs, leveraging internal IT and legal teams; smaller firms often rely on external platforms for bug discovery and rewards.
* In-house programs can serve as recruiting tools; bug hunters are motivated by money, fame, and the desire to improve security, with payouts reaching up to $1 million for critical exploits.
* AI and machine learning are increasing bug report volumes, aiding in flaw detection but also generating noise; platforms plan to use AI moderation to filter spam.
