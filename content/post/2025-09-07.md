### [OpenAI Research Links Language Model Hallucinations to Guessing Over Uncertainty](https://openai.com/index/why-language-models-hallucinate)
OpenAI's [research](https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/d04913be-3f6f-4d2b-b283-ff432ef4aaa5/why-language-models-hallucinate.pdf) attributes hallucinations to training and evaluation practices that reward guessing over uncertainty, highlighting the need to update scoring to reduce confident errors.

* OpenAI's research explains that language model hallucinations occur because training and evaluation reward guessing over uncertainty acknowledgment.
* Hallucinations are plausible but false statements, persisting despite model improvements; GPT-5 has fewer hallucinations, especially in reasoning.
* Current evaluation methods incentivize models to guess rather than admit uncertainty, with accuracy-based metrics encouraging confident errors and hallucinations.
