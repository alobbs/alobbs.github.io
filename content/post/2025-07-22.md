### [Whisper Model Hallucinates "Nancy Qunqar" in Silence Due to Training Artifacts](https://github.com/openai/whisper/discussions/2608)
Whisper's large-v3 model hallucinated "ترجمة نانسي قنقر" in silent audio due to training data artifacts, with suggestions to mitigate including adjusting prompts, suppress tokens, or fine-tuning.

* The discussion highlights that Whisper's model consistently hallucinated "ترجمة نانسي قنقر" ("Translation by Nancy Qunqar") when processing complete silence in audio files.
* Experiments involved generating silent WAV files with ffmpeg and running Whisper with the `--language Arabic` and `large-v3` model, which resulted in the model outputting the phrase regardless of actual speech.
* Multiple contributors suggest that the hallucination stems from training data artifacts, such as subtitles and credits ending with copyright notices or phrases like "don’t forget to like and subscribe," which the model learned to associate with silence or end-of-video cues.
