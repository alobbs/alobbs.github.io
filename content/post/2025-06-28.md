### [Deno's Trademark Battle Over "JavaScript" Continues After Case Dismissal](https://deno.com/blog/deno-v-oracle4)
Deno's legal case against Oracle over the "JavaScript" trademark was dismissed, with proceedings continuing to determine if the term remains a trademark or becomes public domain, potentially freeing the language name.

* Deno's legal challenge against Oracle regarding the "JavaScript" trademark was dismissed by the TTAB on June 18, 2025, with the dispute focusing on issues of genericness and abandonment.
* The case proceeds with Oracle required to respond by August 7, 2025, and discovery starting September 6, 2025; the outcome could result in JavaScript becoming a free, untrademarked term.
* The dispute centers on whether "JavaScript" is a generic term used to describe a programming language, not a trademarked brand, with over 19,550 supporters at [javascript.tm](https://javascript.tm).

### [MCP: The Universal Protocol Connecting Data Sources and Tools Like USB-C](https://worksonmymachine.substack.com/p/mcp-an-accidentally-universal-plugin)
MCP is a universal protocol for connecting diverse data sources and tools, enabling a self-organizing plugin ecosystem akin to USB-C's versatility, with applications like the APM task manager.

* MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open protocol initially designed for AI models to connect to data sources and tools, but functions as a universal connectivity standard.
* It enables any data source or tool to be integrated via MCP servers, creating an emergent universal plugin ecosystem that benefits all applications.
* MCP is compared to USB-C, emphasizing its role as a flexible "protocol for functionality" that can handle power, data, video, and control signals, exemplified by Rex's toaster outputting HDMI.
