### [Government censorship comes to Bluesky, but not its third-party apps ... yet | TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/23/government-censorship-comes-to-bluesky-but-not-its-third-party-apps-yet/)
Bluesky has implemented government-mandated censorship in Turkey via geographic labelers, restricting 72 accounts, while third-party apps can bypass these blocks due to lack of enforced regional moderation.

* Bluesky restricted access to 72 accounts in Turkey at the Turkish government's request, citing national security and public order concerns.
* 59 accounts were blocked, 13 accounts and at least one post made invisible; accounts remain on Bluesky infrastructure.
* Official Bluesky app users cannot opt out of geographic moderation, but third-party apps like Skeets, Ouranos, Deer.social, and Skywalker can bypass these restrictions by not implementing geographic labelers.

### [Does using Rust really make your software safer? - Blog - Tweede golf](https://tweedegolf.nl/en/blog/152/does-using-rust-really-make-your-software-safer)
Using Rust for DNS parsing code prevents memory safety vulnerabilities, as demonstrated by empirical tests showing Rust's robustness against exploits, reducing development time and costs.

* A 2021 vulnerability in Siemens' Nucleus real-time operating system, used by over 3 billion devices, allowed malicious DNS response crafting to overwrite memory.
* The vulnerability stemmed from unsafe DNS response parsing code, enabling crashes or device reprogramming; patched in later versions.
* The security research team conducted an experiment rewriting the DNS unpacking routine in Rust, demonstrating that Rust's memory safety prevents such vulnerabilities, with tests showing no exploitable errors.
* The experiment revealed that Rust code avoided memory unsafe bugs, resulted in recoverable errors during exploits, facilitated thorough testing, and saved development time and costs compared to C implementations.

### [Apple, Meta fined as EU presses ahead with tech probes](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-fined-570-million-meta-094701712.html)
EU regulators fined Apple 500 million euros and Meta 200 million euros for DMA violations, enforcing rules to curb Big Tech's market dominance and requiring compliance within two months.

* EU fined Apple 500 million euros ($570 million) and Meta 200 million euros for non-compliance with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) following a year-long investigation.
* Apple must remove restrictions preventing app developers from steering users to cheaper outside options; Meta's pay-or-consent model breached DMA until November 2024, when it was revised.
* The EU dropped Meta's Marketplace from DMA gatekeeper status due to user count falling below thresholds; Apple avoided a fine on browser options after making compliant changes but was charged for sideloading restrictions.

### [DOGE Worker’s Code Supports NLRB Whistleblower – Krebs on Security](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/04/doge-workers-code-supports-nlrb-whistleblower/)
A whistleblower at the NLRB reported DOGE employees downloaded code from GitHub, including requests-ip-rotator and its fork by Marko Elez, to bypass security controls and transfer sensitive data, raising security and legal concerns.

* Whistleblower at the NLRB alleged DOGE siphoned gigabytes of sensitive case data in early March 2025
* DOGE created accounts with unrestricted permissions to read, copy, alter data, and disable log visibility, delaying or removing logs
* Investigation revealed DOGE downloaded three GitHub code repositories, including requests-ip-rotator and its fork async-ip-rotator, created by Marko Elez, a DOGE employee with prior work at SpaceX, X, and xAI

### [Pluralistic: Sarah Wynn-Williams’s ‘Careless People’ (23 Apr 2025) – Pluralistic: Daily links from Cory Doctorow](https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/23/zuckerstreisand/#zdgaf)
Sarah Wynn-Williams’s _Careless People_ reveals Facebook’s reckless leadership, systemic abuses, and policy failures enabling global harm, driven by growth obsession and regulatory neglect.

* Sarah Wynn-Williams's memoir _Careless People_ details her years managing global policy at Facebook, exposing internal misconduct and corporate recklessness.
* The book was initially suppressed via legal injunction by Meta's lawyers, prompting Wynn-Williams to promote it freely.
* The memoir describes Zuckerberg, Sandberg, and Kaplan as morally reprehensible, highlighting their private misconduct, strategic failures, and reckless behavior, including mishandling global crises and engaging in sexual harassment.
* Facebook prioritized US market dominance, neglecting international issues like Myanmar genocide and Chinese censorship, building surveillance tools for authoritarian regimes.
* The company’s pursuit of growth led to insatiable expansion, acquisitions, and regulatory evasion, culminating in systemic overreach, lies to regulators and advertisers, and a culture of carelessness and arrogance.
* Wynn-Williams argues that Facebook’s recklessness stems from policy failures—lack of antitrust enforcement, privacy protections, and regulation—enabling a culture of indifference to harm.
* The memoir details Facebook’s complicity in global human rights abuses, including Myanmar genocide and suppression in China, and its exploitation of advertising targeting vulnerable groups.
* The company's shift to selling political ads to authoritarian regimes and its strategic acquisitions insulate it from competition and accountability.
* Wynn-Williams’s account emphasizes that Facebook’s carelessness is a policy choice, not just individual flaws, and advocates for regulatory reforms to enforce corporate accountability.

### [US calls EU fines on Apple and Meta 'economic extortion' | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/us-calls-eu-fines-apple-meta-economic-extortion-2025-04-23/)
The US White House condemned EU fines on Apple and Meta as "economic extortion," citing concerns over the Digital Markets Act's extraterritorial impact and potential trade tensions.

* The White House described EU fines on Apple (€500 million) and Meta (€200 million) as "economic extortion" and stated they will not be tolerated.
* The fines follow EU antitrust investigations into compliance with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), aimed at limiting Big Tech's market dominance.
* The EU sanctions are the first under the DMA, which seeks to promote competition by enabling smaller rivals to enter markets dominated by large companies.
