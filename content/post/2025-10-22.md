### [Researchers Develop Safe Rectal Oxygen Delivery for Respiratory Failure](https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/butt-breathing-might-soon-be-a-real-medical-treatment/)
A Cincinnati team demonstrated rectal oxygen delivery in humans as a safe method to potentially treat respiratory failure, inspired by fish and animal studies, with ongoing efficacy evaluation.

* Researchers won the 2024 Ig Nobel Prize for discovering mammals can breathe through their anus via intestinal capillaries.
* A new study tested rectal oxygen delivery (enteral ventilation via anus, EVA) in mice, micro-pigs, and 27 healthy human men, showing safety and feasibility.
* Human trials involved intra-anal administration of perfluorodecalin, with doses from 25 to 1,500 mL; participants experienced mild, temporary abdominal discomfort with no major adverse effects.
* The study aims to evaluate EVA as a method to give lungs rest and aid patients with severe respiratory failure, potentially reducing lung injury from mechanical ventilation.
* The research builds on earlier work with perfluorocarbon liquids like Oxycyte and is inspired by loach fish’s intestinal breathing under hypoxic conditions.
