### [Enhancing Security with Unified Asset Data Aggregation for Better Visibility](https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/12/prelude_security/)
Aggregating asset data from multiple security tools enhances visibility, identifies gaps, and supports proactive security management, improving control coverage and operational efficiency.

* Managing IT assets via aggregated data improves visibility, security posture, and operational efficiency.
* Disparate security tools (e.g., Microsoft Intune, Jamf, CrowdStrike, Tenable, Entra) often report inconsistent asset data, revealing gaps upon aggregation.
* Asset inventory discrepancies include 5,500 total devices, with 200 missing CrowdStrike sensors, 300 lacking MDM, 100 missing vulnerability data, and 150 with misconfigured EDR; 75 users have no device record, 15 with high-risk access.
* Manual data collection and analysis are time-consuming; Prelude Security's platform aims to automate aggregation to reduce effort.
* Aggregated data exposes control gaps in real time, enabling proactive vulnerability mitigation and better control coverage.
* Consolidated inventory supports justified security investments and enhances the effectiveness of existing tools like EDR and IAM.
* Complete visibility into assets helps close security gaps, improve control consistency, and optimize security tool performance.

### [Apple Considers Higher iPhone Prices Amid Supply Chain and Tariff Challenges](https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-iphone-price-increase-2eaebb14?st=S6xbJ4&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink)
Apple plans to raise iPhone prices in the fall without citing tariffs, as high-end models remain produced mainly in China; tariff reductions and supply chain shifts influence pricing and manufacturing strategies.

* Apple considers raising iPhone prices for the fall lineup, aiming to avoid attributing increases to U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods
* The U.S. and China agreed to reduce tariffs to 10%, but a 20% tariff on Chinese smartphones remains in place
* High-end iPhone models (Pro and Pro Max) will continue to be produced mainly in China; Indian manufacturing is insufficient for mass production of these models
* Apple built inventory in March ahead of tariffs and shifted some manufacturing to India, which accounted for 13-14% of global iPhone shipments last year, expected to double in 2025
* The company faces a potential $900 million additional cost this quarter due to tariffs, with plans to explore U.S. production but expects years-long transition
