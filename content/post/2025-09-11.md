### [Akira Ransomware Exploits SonicWall Vulnerabilities and Misconfigurations](https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/10/akira_ransomware_abusing_sonicwall/)
Akira ransomware exploits SonicWall CVE-2024-40766, SSLVPN misconfigurations, and default LDAP settings to gain access, with over 438,000 devices exposed, prompting urgent patching, MFA activation, and access restrictions.

* Akira ransomware exploits SonicWall vulnerabilities, including CVE-2024-40766, a CVSS 9.8 flaw disclosed in August 2024, for initial access and ransomware deployment.
* The attacks leverage SonicWall SSLVPN misconfigurations and default LDAP group settings, enabling over-provisioned access and unauthorized VPN entry.
* Rapid7 reports hundreds of SonicWall users affected, with at least 100 organizations compromised via CVE-2024-40766 between September and December 2024; SonicWall confirmed fewer than 40 recent cases linked to legacy credential use.
* SonicWall advised upgrading to SonicOS 7.3.0, changing credentials, and enabling MFA; recent activity suggests Akira and possibly other ransomware groups are exploiting these vulnerabilities.
* Rapid7 warns default LDAP configurations can over-provision access, and misconfigured Virtual Office portals allow attackers to bypass MFA, facilitating ransomware operations.
