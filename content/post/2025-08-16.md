* The lethal trifecta comprises private data access, untrusted content, and external communication, which together enable data theft and system compromise
* Examples include Markdown exfiltration attacks using image URLs to leak private data and exploits on systems like GitHub MCP, Google DeepMind CaMeL, and others
* Common defenses such as prompt begging and AI-based attack detection are ineffective against adversarial attempts; removing any one of the trifecta's legs can prevent attacks
* The presentation emphasizes that security must constrain untrusted input to prevent consequential actions, referencing research like Google DeepMind's CaMeL and design patterns for secure LLM agents
* The MCP system's current approach of user-configurable modules risks outsourcing critical security decisions, potentially enabling all three legs of the trifecta
