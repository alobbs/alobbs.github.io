### [Transforming RoBERTa into a Text Diffusion Generator for Coherent Text Creation](https://nathan.rs/posts/roberta-diffusion/)
Fine-tuned RoBERTa models can generate coherent text by treating variable masking as a diffusion process, transforming masked language modeling into stepwise text generation with 10 denoising steps.

* The article demonstrates that BERT-like masked language models can be adapted into text diffusion generators by interpreting variable masking as a diffusion process.
* Fine-tuning RoBERTa with a schedule of masking probabilities (from 1.0 to 0.1) over 10 steps enables iterative denoising and coherent text generation.
* The implementation uses custom data collators and iterative inference with top-k/top-p filtering, achieving comparable results to GPT-2 with a simpler approach.
