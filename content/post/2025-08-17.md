### [Wikipedia Uncovers Decade-Long Coordinated Campaign to Inflate David Woodard’s Profile](https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/08/why-was-the-most-translated-wikipedia-article-in-the-world-about-a-lover-of-aryan-culture/)
A Wikipedia investigation revealed a decade-long, coordinated effort involving over 200 accounts to artificially boost David Woodard’s articles in 92 languages, culminating in the removal of 235 articles.

* A Wikipedia investigation identified a network of over 200 accounts and proxy IPs that created approximately 183 articles about David Woodard in 92 languages from 2017 to 2025.
* The activity aimed to artificially inflate Woodard’s prominence, with accounts often making minor edits, creating stub articles, and translating content in diverse languages, including constructed ones.
* Wikimedia stewards removed 235 articles and banned numerous accounts, reducing the total articles about Woodard to 20, indicating a decade-long self-promotion campaign likely orchestrated by Woodard or close associates.

### [OpenAI’s GPT-OSS-120B Performance Varies Widely Across Providers](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/15/inconsistent-performance/)
OpenAI’s gpt-oss-120b shows inconsistent performance across providers, with scores from 36.7% to 93.3%, highlighting challenges in open weight model deployment and the need for conformance testing.

* Artificial Analysis benchmarked OpenAI’s gpt-oss-120b across multiple providers, revealing performance variances from 36.7% (CompactifAI) to 93.3% (Cerebras, Nebius Base, Fireworks, Deepinfra, Novita, Together.ai, vLLM 0.1.0) in AIME 2025 N=32 runs.
* Most high-scoring providers used the latest [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm); Azure’s 80% score was corrected after a fix to their older vLLM implementation.
* CompactifAI’s low score (36.7%) is due to their models being highly compressed, offering 4-12x faster inference and 50-80% cost reduction; OpenAI now includes a [compatibility test](https://github.com/openai/gpt-oss/tree/main/compatibility-test) for providers to verify implementation correctness.
