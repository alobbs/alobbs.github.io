### [RenderFormer: Neural Transformer for Scene-Independent Global Illumination Rendering](https://microsoft.github.io/renderformer/)
RenderFormer is a transformer-based neural rendering system that produces global illumination images directly from triangle meshes without scene-specific training, utilizing a two-stage architecture for triangle-to-pixel translation.

* RenderFormer is a neural rendering pipeline that directly generates images from triangle-based scene representations with full global illumination effects, without requiring per-scene training or fine-tuning.
* It employs a two-stage transformer architecture: a view-independent triangle-to-triangle light transport model and a view-dependent pixel rendering model, both learned with minimal prior constraints, avoiding rasterization and ray tracing.
* Demonstrations include scenes like Cornell Box, Stanford Bunny, Lucy Statue, and complex compositions, rendered with various lighting and materials, validated through a public [GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/renderformer) and [model hub](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/renderformer-v1.1-swin-large).
