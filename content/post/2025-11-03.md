### [Balancer Loses $128M in Exploit; Berachain Halts Chain for Recovery](https://decrypt.co/347173/balancer-exploited-128-million-across-ethereum-chains-berachain-halts)
Balancer lost $128 million from a rounding error exploit in V2 pools, prompting Berachain to halt its chain and prepare a hard fork to recover funds.

* Balancer suffered a $128 million exploit across Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, and other chains, affecting V2 liquidity pools.
* The attack was caused by a rounding error in Balancer V2 pools, exploited via multiple swaps in a single transaction, undervaluing Balancer Pool Tokens.
* Balancer confirmed the issue is isolated to V2 pools; its token dropped over 11%, and the attacker appears to have ceased further withdrawals.
* Berachain halted its blockchain and plans a hard fork to recover approximately $12.86 million, due to its codebase vulnerability similar to Balancer V2.
* The chain halt is contentious, echoing past blockchain rollback debates, notably Ethereum’s 2016 DAO fork.
