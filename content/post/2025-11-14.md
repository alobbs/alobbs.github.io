### [Heartbeat Mechanisms in Distributed Systems: Timing, Algorithms, and Models](https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/heartbeats-in-distributed-systems/)
Distributed systems use heartbeat messages, sent every 1-10 seconds with timeouts 2-3x longer, employing push, pull, or hybrid models, with algorithms like phi accrual and gossip for failure detection.

* Heartbeat mechanisms are fundamental for node liveness detection in distributed systems, involving periodic lightweight messages indicating node health.
* Core components include heartbeat sender (periodically transmits signals) and monitor (tracks last received heartbeat, assesses node health based on timeout thresholds).
* Typical heartbeat intervals range from 1 to 10 seconds; timeouts are set at 2-3 times the interval, balancing failure detection speed and network overhead; algorithms include fixed timeout, phi accrual, and gossip protocols.

### [AGI Dreams vs. Sustainable Innovation: Rethinking AI Development](https://www.tomwphillips.co.uk/2025/11/agi-fantasy-is-a-blocker-to-actual-engineering/)
Tom Phillips argues that AGI fantasies hinder practical engineering by promoting unsustainable scaling and unfalsifiable value estimates, advocating for problem-specific models and responsible resource use.

* OpenAI and Silicon Valley widely believe in the development of AGI, with prominent figures like Elon Musk and Ilya Sutskever promoting the concept.
* OpenAI’s scaling of GPT models, including GPT-2, was driven by the “pure language” hypothesis, requiring extensive data, parameters, and compute resources.
* The pursuit of AGI involves significant environmental costs, including water consumption, CO2 emissions, and exploitation of data workers, with data centers consuming hundreds of liters of water per second and often relying on polluting gas generators.
