### [AI Tools Slow Experienced Developers by 19% by Disrupting Mental Models](https://johnwhiles.com/posts/mental-models-vs-ai-tools)
AI tools slow experienced open-source developers by 19% due to interference with mental model formation, as they rely on internal understanding that current AI cannot replicate effectively.

* A July 2025 [study](https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/) found AI tools slow experienced open-source developers by 19% on familiar codebases, contrary to their belief of increased speed
* Developers overestimate AI productivity gains, believing AI speeds them up by 24%, and maintain this belief even after experiencing slower task completion

### [The Limitations of Scaling Reliable Production AI Agents](https://utkarshkanwat.com/writing/betting-against-agents/)
Building over a dozen production AI systems, the author highlights exponential error compounding, quadratic token costs, and engineering challenges, arguing that reliable, scalable agents require bounded design and human oversight.

* Building 12+ production AI agent systems across development, DevOps, and data operations reveals fundamental mathematical limitations.
* Error rates compound exponentially in multi-step workflows, making 95% per-step reliability insufficient for 20+ steps; 20 steps yield only 36% success.
* Context window costs scale quadratically, making conversational agents economically infeasible at scale; a 100-turn conversation can cost $50-$100 in tokens.
* Successful production agents rely on bounded, verifiable operations with human oversight, not on fully autonomous, multi-step workflows.
* Tool design is critical; effective feedback interfaces, partial failure handling, and structured responses are essential for reliability.
* Integration with complex, legacy enterprise systems involves traditional systems programming, not just AI orchestration.
* Practical, reliable agents operate within strict boundaries, with humans maintaining control over critical decisions and error recovery.
* Predictions indicate that fully autonomous startups will face economic and reliability challenges, while domain-specific, constrained tools will succeed.
* Building reliable AI agents requires clear boundaries, failure handling, cost management, and reliance on traditional engineering for execution and error handling.

* Meta Platforms declined to sign the European Union’s AI code of practice, citing it as an overreach that will hinder growth, according to global affairs chief Joel Kaplan.
* The EU’s AI guidelines, aimed to enhance transparency and safety, are set to take effect next month and are designed to comply with the AI Act enacted last year.
* Several companies, including ASML Holding and Airbus, have called for delaying the AI code, while OpenAI has committed to signing it; Meta opposes the regulations, claiming they introduce legal uncertainties and overreach.

### [Scientists Discover New "Altermagnets" That Could Revolutionize Spintronics and Quantum Tech](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2487013-weve-discovered-a-new-kind-of-magnetism-what-can-we-do-with-it/)
Researchers identified "altermagnets," a new magnet class with unique spin-symmetry properties, potentially advancing spintronics and quantum computing technologies, first discovered in nearly 100 years.

* Researchers discovered the first new magnet type in nearly a century, termed "altermagnets," predicted by Libor Šmejkal in 2022 inspired by M. C. Escher's artwork.
* Traditional magnets are classified as ferromagnets and antiferromagnets; altermagnets exhibit a distinct spin-symmetry-breaking magnetic order, enabling unique electronic properties.
* Altermagnets could facilitate development of novel spintronic devices and quantum computers due to their unconventional magnetic behavior.
