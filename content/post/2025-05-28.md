### [EU Orders Apple to Comply with App Store Rules or Face Penalties](https://9to5mac.com/2025/05/27/apple-dma-30-days-deadline/)
The EU’s [regulatory ruling](https://ec.europa.eu/competition/digital_markets_act/cases/202522/DMA_100109_906.pdf) finds Apple’s App Store practices still violate DMA rules, requiring 30 days for compliance or face penalties, due to ongoing anti-steering restrictions and inadequate modifications.

* European Commission published a [full ruling](https://ec.europa.eu/competition/digital_markets_act/cases/202522/DMA_100109_906.pdf) against Apple’s App Store practices, citing non-compliance with DMA.
