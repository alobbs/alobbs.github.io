### [HMRC pauses Uber VAT demands after Bolt legal win](https://t.co/Jx1TS3Ii4j)
HMRC paused enforcement of VAT assessments on Uber's UK rides, following legal rulings favoring Bolt's scheme coverage, impacting over £1.4bn in disputed tax payments.

* HMRC halted demands for Uber to pay VAT on full ride fares after legal setbacks related to Bolt, including an upper tribunal ruling confirming Bolt's coverage under the Tour Operators’ Margin Scheme.
* HMRC previously required Uber to pay VAT on entire fares since 2022 following a UK Supreme Court ruling that classified drivers as employees; assessments totaled over £1.4bn, though Uber disputes acceptance.
* HMRC indicated a softened stance, stating it will not enforce assessments pending the outcome of an appeal involving a related matter; the dispute adds legal ambiguity to UK ridesharing tax obligations.
