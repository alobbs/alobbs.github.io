### [Anubis CAPTCHA Fails to Block AI Web Crawlers Due to Low Mining Cost](https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/anubis.html)
Anubis employs SHA-256 proof-of-work challenges to block web crawlers, but the low computational cost for resourceful attackers renders it ineffective against AI-driven mass scraping.

* Anubis is a network countermeasure that blocks access by requiring clients to perform SHA-256 proof-of-work similar to bitcoin mining, with a default difficulty of 4 leading zero nibbles.
* Typical challenge difficulty (4 zero nibbles) requires approximately 2^16 SHA-256 operations; with 11,508 GitHub stars, mining tokens for all deployed sites would cost roughly $0 per week based on cloud compute estimates.
* The proof-of-work approach is ineffective against resource-rich AI crawlers, as their datacenter capacity makes mining trivial and cost negligible, undermining its intended purpose.
