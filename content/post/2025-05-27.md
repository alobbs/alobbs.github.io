### [Critical GitHub MCP Vulnerability Exposes Private Data via Malicious Issues](https://invariantlabs.ai/blog/mcp-github-vulnerability)
Invariant revealed a critical vulnerability in GitHub MCP allowing attackers to exfiltrate private repository data via malicious issues, exploiting toxic agent flows detected by automated security analysis.

* Vulnerability affects the GitHub MCP server ([github/github-mcp-server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server)), with 14k stars, enabling attackers to access private repositories via malicious GitHub issues.
* Attack involves hijacking a user's agent through a malicious issue, coercing it to leak private repository data into a public pull request.
* Invariant's security scanner identified this as a toxic agent flow, a form of prompt injection that manipulates agent behavior without compromising MCP tools themselves.

## ▶️ Software Development

### [How to Use Timeout with Bash 'Until' Loops Effectively](https://heitorpb.github.io/bla/timeout/)
Using `timeout` with `until` in Bash requires wrapping `until` in a Bash process (`timeout 1m bash -c "until ..."`), or placing `until` in a separate script and applying `timeout` to that script.

* Example: `timeout 1s sleep 5` terminates `sleep` after 1 second, returning exit code 124
* Direct use of `timeout` with Bash `until` keyword is not possible because `until` is a shell keyword, not a process
