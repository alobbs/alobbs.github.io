### [Vision Models Often See Nonexistent Optical Illusions, Revealing Perception Gaps](https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/19/vision_language_models_see_illusions/)
Vision language models frequently perceive non-existent optical illusions, revealing gaps in AI perception accuracy; top models recognize real illusions but also false positives, as shown in Ullman's [research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18613).

* Vision language models, including GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini Pro Vision, miniGPT, Qwen-VL, InstructBLIP, BLIP2, and LLaVA-1.5, tend to see optical illusions where none exist.
* In experiments, models misidentified images of a duck as an optical illusion that can also be seen as a rabbit, despite only providing a duck image.
* The phenomenon, described in Thomas Ullman's preprint [The Illusion-Illusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18613), indicates models' tendency to perceive non-existent visual ambiguities, with top models recognizing actual illusions but also false positives.
