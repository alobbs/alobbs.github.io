### [Balancing Privacy, Accessibility, and Bot Resistance in Ticketing Security](https://behind.pretix.eu/2025/05/23/captchas-are-over/)
Traditional CAPTCHAs are obsolete for ticketing bot prevention; effective solutions now require balancing privacy, accessibility, and bot resistance, with technological limits making full protection challenging.

* Traditional CAPTCHAs (text, image, audio recognition) are no longer effective against modern AI-based bots in ticketing.
* Behavior analysis solutions like reCAPTCHA v3 raise privacy concerns and risk false positives, especially in high-demand ticketing contexts.
* Proof of work schemes are ineffective for ticket scalping due to high economic incentives; AI and low-cost human CAPTCHA bypass services persist.
* Strategies such as ticket personalization, ID verification, and purchase limits tied to verified resources are proposed as more effective alternatives.
* The "BAP theorem" states that only two of the following can be achieved simultaneously: bot-resistance, accessibility, privacy-friendliness.
* Legal accessibility requirements force event organizers to choose between privacy and bot protection, with technological solutions unable to fully reconcile all three goals.

### [Algebraic Effects Enhance Control Flow and API Design with Improved Efficiency](https://antelang.org/blog/why_effects/)
Algebraic effects enable flexible control flow, dependency injection, and cleaner APIs, supporting implementation of generators, exceptions, and state management, with recent improvements addressing efficiency concerns.

* Algebraic effects (effect handlers) are a growing feature in programming languages like Ante, Koka, Effekt, Eff, and Flix, with focus on their use-cases.
* They enable user-defined control flow, allowing implementation of generators, exceptions, coroutines, and asynchronous operations as libraries.
* Effects facilitate dependency injection, cleaner APIs, and substitution for globals, improving modularity and testability.
* They support writing in a direct style, simplifying error handling and effect composition, and enable guarantees of purity, replayability, and capability-based security.
* Effects can be used for effectful abstractions like database access, logging, random number generation, and memory allocation, allowing swapping implementations via handlers.
* They improve API design by encapsulating context and state management, reducing boilerplate, and avoiding explicit parameter passing.
* Effects help enforce effect annotations, aiding in security auditing and effect-based capability control.
