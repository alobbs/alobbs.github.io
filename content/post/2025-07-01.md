### [Spegel: An LLM-Powered Terminal Browser for Personalized Markdown Web Viewing](https://simedw.com/2025/06/23/introducing-spegel/)
Spegel is a terminal browser leveraging LLMs to convert web pages into markdown via prompts, enabling personalized, distraction-free content viewing with improved inference speed from Gemini 2.5 Pro Lite.

* Spegel is a proof-of-concept terminal web browser that uses an LLM to transform HTML content into markdown for terminal rendering, supporting only GET requests and no JavaScript.
* It processes HTML through prompts stored in a configuration file (~/.spegel.toml), enabling personalized views such as summarization or highlighting key actions.
* The system was developed over a weekend, with recent improvements from Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro Lite increasing inference speed, enhancing practicality.

### [The Rise of Context Engineering for Smarter AI Agents](https://www.philschmid.de/context-engineering)
Context Engineering involves designing dynamic, system-based contexts that supply relevant information and tools to LLMs, improving agent success by emphasizing context quality over prompt simplicity.

* Context Engineering shifts focus from prompt engineering to designing dynamic systems that provide all relevant information and tools for LLM tasks.
* Effective AI agents depend on high-quality context, including instructions, user prompts, conversation history, long-term memory, external retrieval (RAG), available tools, and output formats.
* Building powerful agents involves engineering the context system to deliver the right data and capabilities at the right time, not just optimizing prompts or model parameters.

### [Microsoft Copilot Fails to Beat Atari 2600 in Video Chess Challenge](https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/01/microsoft_copilot_joins_chatgpt_at/)
Microsoft Copilot attempted to play Atari 2600 Video Chess, overestimating its strategic ability, but lost to the vintage hardware, exposing AI overconfidence and limitations in spatial memory.

* Robert Caruso tested Microsoft's Copilot against Atari 2600 Video Chess emulator on July 1, 2025
* Copilot claimed it could think 10–15 moves ahead and maintain game continuity despite known spatial memory gaps
* The AI lost to the Atari 2600, losing multiple pawns, a knight, and a bishop, with discrepancies between perceived and actual board states
