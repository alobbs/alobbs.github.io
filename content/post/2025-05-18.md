### [US Government App Hacked in 20 Minutes Due to Server Misconfiguration](https://www.wired.com/story/how-the-signal-knock-off-app-telemessage-got-hacked-in-20-minutes/)
A TeleMessage app clone used by US officials was hacked in 20 minutes via a misconfigured Spring Boot server exposing heap dump endpoints, revealing unencrypted chat logs and credentials.

* TeleMessage’s app used by US government officials was hacked in approximately 15-20 minutes due to a misconfigured server.
* The exploit involved accessing a Java heap dump via a publicly exposed Spring Boot /heapdump endpoint, containing unencrypted user credentials and chat logs.
* The breach revealed plaintext chat logs, user credentials, and sensitive data, including messages from a US Customs and Border Protection user and Coinbase internal chats.
* The attack exploited outdated or misconfigured Spring Boot applications, where heap dump endpoints were exposed without authentication, a common security risk.
* TeleMessage’s architecture, which uploaded unencrypted messages to an archive server, contradicts its marketing claim of end-to-end encryption.
