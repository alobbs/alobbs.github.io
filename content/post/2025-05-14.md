### [Nextcloud Android App Limited by Google Permission Revocation](https://nextcloud.com/blog/nextcloud-android-file-upload-issue-google/)
Nextcloud's Android app cannot upload all files due to Google’s permission revocation in September 2024, citing security concerns, impacting millions and exemplifying Big Tech gatekeeping practices.

* Nextcloud Android app's file upload feature has been limited since Google revoked a critical permission in September 2024, restricting uploads to photos and videos only.
* Google cites security concerns for permission revocation; Nextcloud has used this feature since 2016 without reported issues, and Google’s own apps still have it.
* Despite multiple appeals, Google refuses to reinstate full file upload permissions, forcing Nextcloud to limit functionality for approximately one million users on Google Play.

### [Intel Targets 2027 Break-Even for Foundry Business Through External Customers](https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/14/intel_14a_customers/)
Intel seeks external foundry customers for its 14A process node to achieve 2027 break-even, relying on high NA EUV tools and partnerships, amid workforce reductions and strategic organizational changes.

* Intel aims for its foundry division to break even by 2027, targeting external customers for its 14A process node.
* The 14A node, utilizing high NA EUV tools from ASML, is expected to require external volume to be financially viable.
* Intel's 18A process will primarily serve internal products, with first SKU (Panther Lake) expected by end of 2025; 18A's internal volume reduces reliance on external foundry business.
* CFO David Zinsner states that 14A will be more expensive, but expects external volume to increase, driven by partnerships with UMC and Tower Semiconductor.
* Intel procured at least two high NA EUV tools from ASML, with the process expected to be used mainly for high-performance and AI chips.
* The company anticipates low to mid-single digit billions of dollars in external revenue for the foundry, with a mix of older and newer process generations.
* The global supply chain issues have increased customer interest in second sourcing, positioning Intel Foundry as a potential alternative.
* Intel plans to shed up to 20% of its workforce (~20,000 employees) to improve execution and organizational efficiency under CEO Lip-Bu Tan.

### [The Rise and Fall of Bell Labs: Autonomy, Innovation, and Cultural Shifts](https://1517.substack.com/p/why-bell-labs-worked)
Bell Labs thrived due to researcher autonomy, selective talent, and long-term focus; its decline correlates with corporate and cultural shifts toward short-term metrics and reduced scientific freedom.

* Bell Labs was founded by Alexander Graham Bell with a management style that emphasized researcher autonomy and shared credit, starting in the early 20th century.
* During WWII, Bell Labs rapidly reverse-engineered the British Magnetron, developed anti-aircraft technology, and invented key innovations like pulse code modulation and the first anti-aircraft missile.
* Bell Labs declined after AT&T's breakup, as the culture of radical freedom was replaced by short-term shareholder pressures, with modern tech giants investing more in research but lacking similar institutional independence.

### [pkill -H flag improves process safety by targeting only signals with handlers](https://chrisdown.name/2025/05/13/safer-signal-sending-with-pkill-require-handler.html)
`pkill --require-handler` (`-H`) prevents signals from being sent to processes without handlers by inspecting `/proc/[pid]/status`, reducing outages caused by unhandled signals like `SIGHUP`.

* The `pkill --require-handler` (`-H`) flag ensures signals are only sent to processes with registered handlers, preventing unintended termination.
* Default signal dispositions, such as for `SIGHUP`, `SIGUSR1`, and `SIGUSR2`, often terminate processes if no handler exists, causing production outages.
* `pkill -H` reads `/proc/[pid]/status` and checks the `SigCgt` bitmap to verify if a process has a handler for a specific signal before sending it.
