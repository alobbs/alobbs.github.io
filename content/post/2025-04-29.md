### [Windows 7 Logon Delays Caused by Desktop Component Reporting Issues Fixed in 2009](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20250428-00/?p=111121)
Windows 7 experienced a 30-second logon delay with solid color backgrounds due to desktop component reporting issues, fixed in November 2009, involving wallpaper load and group policy handling.

* Windows 7 logon slowdown occurred for several months when using a solid color background, notably in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.
* The delay was caused by the logon system waiting for desktop components, such as wallpaper loading or desktop icons, to report readiness, with a 30-second timeout.
* Specific issues included the wallpaper load code not reporting ready if no bitmap was defined and group policies (e.g., "Hide desktop icons") delaying the report, extending the Welcome screen duration rather than actual logon time.
