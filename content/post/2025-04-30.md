### [Using Zip Bombs to Defend Servers from Malicious Web Bots](https://idiallo.com/blog/zipbomb-protection)
The article describes using zip bombs—small compressed files that expand into large sizes—to protect servers from malicious bots by crashing their processes through crafted gzip responses, exemplified by a command generating a 10GB zip bomb.

* The article explains using zip bombs as a defensive technique against malicious web bots by serving compressed files that expand into large payloads, crashing the bots.
* It details creating a zip bomb with the command: `dd if=/dev/zero bs=1G count=10 | gzip -c > 10GB.gz`, which generates a 10GB zero-byte file compressed into approximately 10MB.
* The author’s server employs middleware that detects malicious requests via IP blacklisting and heuristics, serving zip bombs with headers like `Content-Encoding: deflate, gzip` and `Content-Length` to crash aggressive bots.
