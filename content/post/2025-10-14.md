### [Why SQLite Uses C for Performance and Stability](https://www.sqlite.org/whyc.html)
SQLite is coded in C for performance, compatibility, low dependencies, and stability; recoding in other languages like Rust is considered only if preconditions are met.

* SQLite is implemented in C since its inception on 2000-05-29, citing performance, compatibility, low-dependency, and stability as primary reasons.
* C enables high performance by allowing low-level hardware access, and is considered "portable assembly language."
* Nearly all systems can call C libraries, ensuring broad compatibility across platforms like Android and iPhone.
* C has minimal runtime dependencies, requiring only routines like `memcmp()`, `memcpy()`, `memmove()`, `memset()`, `strcmp()`, `strlen()`, and `strncmp()`.
* C's age and well-understood nature contribute to SQLite's stability, avoiding issues from language specification changes.
* SQLite is not coded in object-oriented languages like C++ or Java due to interoperability challenges and design considerations.
* It is also not in "safe" languages like Rust or Go because of historical absence, potential performance impacts, and current limitations in error recovery and branch testing.

### [Researchers demonstrate Pixnapping Android attack bypassing security patches](https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/no-fix-yet-for-attack-that-lets-hackers-pluck-2fa-codes-from-android-phones/)
Researchers demonstrated Pixnapping, a side channel attack on Android that extracts 2FA codes and private messages by timing pixel rendering, bypassing recent security patches on Pixel and Galaxy S25.

* The Pixnapping attack exploits a side channel in Android to covertly read sensitive on-screen data, including 2FA codes and private messages, without requiring permissions.
* The attack involves three steps: invoking target app visual content, performing pixel-level graphical operations, and timing measurements to infer pixel colors.
* Google released mitigations in September 2025, with additional patches in December 2025; however, a modified attack can bypass these updates, and the attack has demonstrated success on Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy S25 devices.

### [AI Risks Are Misunderstood: Training Data, Not Code, Causes Unpredictable Behaviors](https://boydkane.com/essays/boss)
The article explains that AI systems are fundamentally different from regular software, with vulnerabilities arising from training data and unpredictable behaviors, challenging traditional debugging and safety assumptions.

* The article argues that public understanding of AI risks is based on misconceptions rooted in regular software assumptions.
* Modern AI systems differ fundamentally from traditional software: vulnerabilities stem from training data, not code mistakes, and behaviors are unpredictable.
* AI bugs are caused by training data issues in datasets exceeding trillions of words, making pinpointing and fixing bugs impossible; behaviors are not reliably fixable or repeatable.
