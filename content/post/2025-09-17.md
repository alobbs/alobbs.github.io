### [Australia mandates multi-method age verification for social media by 2025](https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/17/australia_kids_social_ban_guidance/)
Australia’s eSafety regulator requires social media platforms to use multiple independent age assurance methods, including content and activity analysis, to block under-16s by December 10, 2025, with imperfect tech and flexibility for platforms.

* Australia’s eSafety commissioner mandates social media platforms to employ multiple age assurance techniques to prevent children under 16 from accessing services from December 10, 2025
* Platforms must use a “waterfall approach” with techniques such as account age, content engagement, linguistic analysis, visual and audio content analysis, activity patterns, and user connections
* The final report indicates age assurance technology works imperfectly; platforms must choose methods that do not block substantial numbers of adults to pass reasonableness tests
* Guidance emphasizes “reasonable steps” to prevent under-16 access, including account suspension options and data preservation for minors
* Platforms failing to implement adequate age verification face substantial fines; the approach allows flexibility but expects kindness and clear communication with underage users

### [UK Transfers Google to Microsoft Migration to Cut Costs Amid Delays](https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/17/cabinet_office_microsoft_migration/)
The UK Cabinet Office has transferred its delayed Google to Microsoft 365 migration project to DESNZ, aiming to cut costs from £51M to £23M, amid resource and timeline concerns.

* The UK Cabinet Office has delegated the stalled migration from Google Workspace to Microsoft 365 (M365) to another department.
* The project, initiated in May 2022 to migrate approximately 15,000 users, was initially managed under the "Falcon programme" aimed at building a custom IT system.
* The National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority (NISTA) reported that the management of the project was not cost-effective, with the whole life cost estimated to decrease from £51 million to £23 million after shifting to the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ).
* The revised plan involves moving digital services to the shared government platform, Integrated Corporate Services (ICS), managed by DESNZ, which is expected to extend the timeline but reduce long-term costs.
* The project remains rated "red" by NISTA due to resource concerns and delays, notably the September 2025 pilot completion.
* The cost savings stem from outsourcing migration resources to Microsoft and other government departments, eliminating the need for Cabinet Office to develop its own platform.
* The transition is critical due to the incompatibility of Google and Microsoft systems, which hampers collaboration within government and with external partners.
* The initial migration pause was announced last year, with the Cabinet Office hiring Capgemini for £12-15 million to assist with the process.
* The project’s delay and management issues highlight ongoing challenges in UK government digital transformation efforts.
