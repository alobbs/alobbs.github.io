* Modern browsers, specifically Chromium-based ones, support native, declarative page transitions via the [View Transitions API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions/), enabling CSS-based animations between documents without JavaScript.
* CSS transitions, shared element animations, and speculation rules allow for smooth, real page navigation, shared element animations, and instant preloaded navigation, reducing reliance on JavaScript-heavy SPAs.
* Native browser features like [bfcache](https://web.dev/articles/bfcache) and declarative transitions outperform traditional SPAs in performance, SEO, and accessibility, with examples showing 0KB JavaScript bundles and faster TTI (~1s) compared to SPAs (~3.5–5s).
