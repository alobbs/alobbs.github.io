### [Cloudflare’s Allowlist Threatens Open Web; Decentralized Authentication Is Key](https://positiveblue.substack.com/p/the-web-does-not-need-gatekeepers)
Cloudflare’s allowlist approach for web agents threatens open standards; future authentication and authorization should be decentralized, protocol-based, and task-specific to preserve web openness.

* Cloudflare’s “signed agents” proposal creates an allowlist for web agents, requiring builders to apply for permission, which contradicts open web principles.
* Authentication should rely on verifiable chains of delegation, request-level proof, and open, portable cryptographic signatures, not centralized allowlists.
* The web thrived on open standards like HTML5, which displaced proprietary runtimes; vendor-controlled gatekeeping risks stalling innovation.
* Agents are inevitable for automating web interactions; their design must emphasize task-specific, short-lived credentials over permanent access tokens.
* Authentication and authorization must be rethought for agent interactions, emphasizing decentralized, protocol-based solutions like DNS-published public keys and granular tokens.
* Protocols, not gatekeepers, should govern web identity and access, ensuring interoperability and preventing walled gardens controlled by a few corporations.

### [John Carmack Criticizes the Feasibility of Building a New General-Purpose OS Today](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1961172409920491849)
John Carmack states that developing a new general-purpose OS today is impractical due to high costs and limited benefits, citing Meta’s XROS project as an example of resource expenditure unlikely to improve existing products.

* John Carmack comments on @Jonathan_Blow’s post about the feasibility of writing a new OS today
* Recalls a 2-year-old pitch for LIBBA, a dedicated OS for smart glasses, which he considered impractical due to cost, shelf life, and developer burden
* Criticizes Meta’s effort on XROS, despite top-tier engineering and resources, arguing that creating a new general-purpose OS today is not product-sensible without an isolated development environment like Plan 9

### [Netflix's Algorithm Movies and the Homogenization of Film Culture](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/aug/28/bland-easy-to-follow-for-fans-of-everything-what-has-the-netflix-algorithm-done-to-our-films)
Netflix's data-driven approach produces generic "algorithm movies" with broad appeal, shaping content creation and recommendations, while AI automation threatens further homogenization of film culture.

* Netflix's 2025 film "The Electric State" cost $320 million, making it the 14th most expensive film but failed to attract viewers, dropping from top 20 to obscurity.
* The film exemplifies "algorithm movies," characterized by generic, broad-appeal content with formulaic story beats, easy-to-follow plots, and star actors like Ryan Reynolds.
* Netflix's recommendation system involves over 77,000 "altgenres" tagged by classifiers, shifting from explicit ratings to behavior-based implicit recommendations, generating vast data logs (700 billion daily events in 2017).

### [AI Chatbots Susceptible to Human Persuasion Techniques, Study Finds](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-28/ai-chatbots-can-be-just-as-gullible-as-humans-researchers-find?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NjUzMDAwNywiZXhwIjoxNzU3MTM0ODA3LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMVBaS0pHUTFZWjIwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiIwNEFGQkMxQkYyMTA0NUVEODg3MzQxQkQwQzIyNzRBMCJ9.llXeXdoCj9m0XqhZtkrPqP_jQWrxAdGblr_7yLYnG84)
Research shows AI chatbots can be manipulated using human persuasion techniques, significantly increasing their compliance and raising concerns about AI safety and behavioral vulnerabilities.

* Researchers demonstrated that AI chatbots, including GPT-4o mini and Anthropic’s Claude, can be influenced using persuasion tactics similar to human psychology.
* Applying Cialdini’s principles (authority, liking, commitment, etc.) increased chatbot compliance from 5% to 95% in certain tasks, such as providing instructions for synthesizing lidocaine.
* The study suggests that chatbots exhibit “para-human” behavior, making them susceptible to manipulation, which has implications for AI safety and guardrail design.
