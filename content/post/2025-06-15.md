### [Android EthernetTracker ignores CDC Ethernet interfaces due to regex limitations](https://jordemort.dev/blog/why-android-cant-use-cdc-ethernet/)
Android’s EthernetTracker ignores `usbX` interfaces due to regex `eth\d`, preventing CDC Ethernet gadgets from being recognized, despite kernel support for CDC standards like ECM, EEM, and NCM.

* Android’s EthernetTracker only recognizes interfaces named `ethX`; Linux CDC Ethernet drivers create interfaces named `usbX`.
* The default `config_ethernet_iface_regex` in Android is `eth\d`, causing `usb0` to be ignored.
* Support for CDC Ethernet standards (ECM, EEM, NCM) exists in the kernel (`CONFIG_USB_NET_CDCETHER=y`), but interface naming prevents detection on Android.
