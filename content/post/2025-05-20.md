### [Use Browser Language Settings Instead of IP Geolocation for Accurate User Language Detection](https://vitonsky.net/blog/2025/05/17/language-detection/)
Rely on the browser's `Accept-Language` header for accurate user language detection, avoiding IP geolocation, which is unreliable and causes user dissatisfaction.

* Using IP geolocation for language detection is unreliable due to VPNs, travel, and multilingual regions, leading to user frustration.
* Countries like Belgium, Switzerland, India, and Canada have multiple official languages, making country-based language assumptions inaccurate.
* Browsers send an `Accept-Language` header indicating user language preferences, which should be used instead of IP-based methods.
* The `Accept-Language` header example: `Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9,de;q=0.8`.
* Recommended approach: read and respect `Accept-Language`, allow user adjustments, and use GeoIP only for currency, shipping, or legal purposes.
