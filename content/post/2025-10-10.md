### [Python's str.splitlines() Recognizes Extensive Unicode Line Boundaries](https://yossarian.net/til/post/python-s-splitlines-does-a-lot-more-than-just-newlines/)
Python's `str.splitlines()` splits strings on a comprehensive set of line boundaries, including Unicode control characters beyond standard newlines, affecting string parsing and processing.

* Python's `str.splitlines()` splits strings on a broad set of line boundaries, including `\n`, `\r`, `\r\n`, and additional Unicode separators such as `\v`, `\f`, `\x1c`, `\x1d`, `\x1e`, `\x85`, `\u2028`, and `\u2029`.
* The method's behavior exceeds the standard "universal newlines" definition, resulting in splitting at various control characters.
* Example: `'line1\nline2\rline3\r\nline4\vline5\x1dhello'.splitlines()` yields `['line1', 'line2', 'line3', 'line4', 'line5', 'hello']`, demonstrating its extended boundary recognition.

### [The Hidden Challenge of Assessing Software Engineers' Talent](https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2025/10/08/the-illegible-nature-of-software-development-talent/)
The article discusses the difficulty in assessing software development talent externally due to legibility issues, emphasizing that highly skilled engineers often lack visible online activity, complicating hiring and promotion processes.

* Talented software engineers often remain invisible externally, with minimal online footprints and limited public contributions.
* Decision-makers struggle with a legibility problem, relying on observable but often ineffective indicators like LinkedIn profiles and GitHub activity.
* Industry evaluation methods tend to favor easily observable traits, risking the undervaluation of engineers working in less visible roles or companies.
