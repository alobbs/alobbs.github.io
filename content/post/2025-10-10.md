### [Brainstem “Off Switch” May Unlock Chronic Pain Treatments](https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/select-neurons-brainstem-may-hold-key-treating-chronic-pain)
Research by J. Nicholas Betley and colleagues reveals a brainstem “off switch” involving Y1R neurons in the lateral parabrachial nucleus that suppresses long-term pain signals, offering new avenues for chronic pain treatment.

* Nearly 50 million people in the U.S. suffer from chronic pain, which can last for decades and is often untreatable.
* Research led by neuroscientist J. Nicholas Betley identifies a brainstem hub with a built-in “off switch” involving Y1 receptor (Y1R)-expressing neurons in the lateral parabrachial nucleus (lPBN) that modulate persistent pain signals.
* Y1R neurons are activated during long-term pain and integrate signals related to hunger, fear, and thirst, with NPY signaling dampening pain transmission; these neurons are scattered across multiple cell types, suggesting a complex network.
* Using calcium imaging in preclinical models, researchers observed that Y1R neurons exhibit tonic activity during enduring pain, akin to an engine idling, which may encode persistent pain states.
* The discovery suggests potential for targeting these neurons as biomarkers for chronic pain and developing treatments that modulate brain circuits, including behavioral interventions like exercise and meditation.

### [Microsoft Warns of Cybercriminal Group Hijacking University Payrolls](https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/10/microsoft_payroll_pirate/)
Microsoft warns of Storm-2657’s campaign hijacking university payrolls through phishing, MFA hijacking, and HR system breaches, emphasizing the need for phishing-resistant MFA methods and cross-system telemetry monitoring.

* Microsoft’s Threat Intelligence team reports a cybercrime group, Storm-2657, targeting US university payroll systems since March 2025
* Attackers phish staff, breach HR systems like Workday via MFA hijacking, and reroute paychecks into attacker-controlled bank accounts
* The campaign involves phishing emails with adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) techniques, account breaches, inbox rule manipulations, and MFA device additions, exploiting poor MFA hygiene and configuration
