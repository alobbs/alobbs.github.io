### [Microsoft Recommends Registry Hack to Fix Smart Card Issues After October 2025 Windows Update](https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/23/microsoft_smart_card_registry/)
Microsoft advises applying a registry hack (`DisableCapiOverrideForRSA=0`) to temporarily fix smart card authentication issues caused by the October 2025 Windows Update, which intentionally broke CSP-based RSA certificate support.

* Microsoft recommends a registry hack to mitigate smart card authentication failures caused by the October 2025 Windows Update.
* The update intentionally broke smart card certificate operations by requiring RSA certificates to use KSP instead of CSP; issues include sign-in failures and recognition problems.
* The workaround involves setting the `DisableCapiOverrideForRSA` registry key to 0 on affected devices; this fix applies to nearly all supported Windows versions, including Windows 10 22H2, and is temporary until April 2026 when Microsoft plans to remove it.

### [Microsoft patches prompt injection flaw in Microsoft 365 Copilot enabling data theft](https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/24/m365_copilot_mermaid_indirect_prompt_injection/)
Microsoft patched an indirect prompt injection vulnerability in [Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/24/m365_copilot_mermaid_indirect_prompt_injection/) that enabled data exfiltration through Mermaid diagrams, involving malicious CSS/JavaScript to steal tenant emails.

* Microsoft fixed a vulnerability in Microsoft 365 Copilot allowing indirect prompt injection that could exfiltrate tenant data, including emails.
* The exploit used Mermaid diagrams' support for CSS and JavaScript to generate fake login buttons that sent hex-encoded email data to attacker-controlled servers.
* Researcher Adam Logue discovered the flaw, which involved embedding malicious instructions via Mermaid diagrams; Microsoft verified and patched the issue, but Logue did not receive a bug bounty as Copilot is out of scope.

### [Linux Boot Sequence: From CPU Reset to Kernel Initialization and Security Features](https://www.0xkato.xyz/linux-boot/)
The Linux boot process involves CPU real mode startup, firmware (BIOS/UEFI) initialization, bootloader loading, setup execution, mode switching to 64-bit long mode with paging, kernel decompression, relocation, and optional address randomization for security.

* The Linux boot process begins with CPU reset to real mode at address 0xFFFFFFF0, executing a jump to firmware.
* BIOS performs POST, checks boot devices for 512-byte boot sector ending with 0x55AA, and loads it at 0x7C00; UEFI replaces BIOS with direct filesystem access.
* The bootloader (e.g., GRUB) loads the Linux kernel, which contains a setup program and compressed kernel; setup creates a predictable workspace, clears BSS, configures segment registers, and queries RAM via e820.
* The setup code calls `main` in real mode, then switches to protected mode by disabling interrupts, opening A20 line, loading GDT/IDT, and setting CR0.PE, transitioning to 32-bit mode.
* To run in 64-bit long mode, the kernel enables paging with identity mappings, sets LME in EFER, and performs a far return into 64-bit code, establishing virtual address translation.
* The decompression stage unpacks the kernel ELF, applies relocations if loaded at a non-default address, and jumps to `start_kernel`.
* Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (kASLR) randomly chooses physical and virtual base addresses from free memory regions, unless disabled with `nokaslr`, enhancing security.
