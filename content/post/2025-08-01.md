### [Prioritize Code Quality and Consistency Over Speed in Development](https://alexkondov.com/i-know-when-youre-vibe-coding/)
The article highlights concerns about "vibe coding," emphasizing the need for developers to care about code quality, consistency, and maintainability, especially when using LLMs, rather than rushing to deploy.

* The author emphasizes the importance of code quality and adherence to project conventions over how code enters the IDE, whether by hand, forum copy, LLM prompt, or simulation.
* Recognizes "vibe coding" as code that works but violates established patterns, such as unnecessary utility functions, global configs, or class usage in a functional codebase.
* Criticizes the rush to deploy software quickly, comparing it to rushing a coffee order, and advocates for prioritizing maintainability, consistency, and long-term care over speed.



## ▶️ Management and Leadership
