### [ASUS DriverHub RPC Flaw Allows RCE Exploitation Before Patch](https://mrbruh.com/asusdriverhub/)
A security researcher exploited a flaw in ASUS DriverHub's RPC interface, enabling remote code execution through malicious driver and configuration file downloads, leading to a patch issued on 18/04/2025.

* Vulnerability in ASUS DriverHub's RPC interface allows remote code execution (RCE) via unvalidated origin headers and malicious file downloads.
* Attack chain involves exploiting UpdateApp endpoint to download and execute a signed ASUS binary that runs a malicious executable specified in a configuration file.
* ASUS patched the vulnerability with a fix confirmed on 18/04/2025; CVEs [CVE-2025-3462](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3462) and [CVE-2025-3463](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3463) published on 09/05/2025.

### [Critique of MCP HTTP Transport Flaws and the Case for WebSockets](https://raz.sh/blog/2025-05-02_a_critical_look_at_mcp)
The article critiques MCP's poorly documented, complex HTTP transport implementations, recommending WebSockets as a more secure, scalable, and straightforward alternative for LLM application communication.

* The article critically examines the Model Context Protocol (MCP), highlighting poor documentation, inconsistent implementations, and questionable design choices, especially in HTTP transport modes.
* MCP uses JSON-RPC with methods designed for LLM interaction, supporting transports like stdio and "Streamable HTTP," which emulates socket behavior over HTTP.
* The author advocates replacing the complex, error-prone HTTP+SSE and "Streamable HTTP" modes with WebSockets, citing security, scalability, and simplicity concerns.

### [Lloyd’s Launches AI Malfunction Insurance Covering Chatbot Performance Risks](https://t.co/CPdT5SGbxx)
Lloyd’s insurers introduced AI malfunction liability coverage by Armilla, addressing risks from chatbot errors, with policies covering damages, legal costs, and performance degradation thresholds.

* Lloyd’s of London insurers launched a product to cover losses caused by malfunctioning AI tools, developed by Armilla, backed by Y Combinator.
* Policies cover costs such as damages, legal fees, and court claims if AI underperformance harms third parties or customers.
* Coverage assesses AI degradation; payout triggered if AI performance falls below initial expectations (e.g., correct info rate drops from 95% to 85%).

### [European Courts Mandate DNS Blocks of Pirate Sites; OpenDNS Suspends Service](https://torrentfreak.com/dns-piracy-blocking-orders-google-cloudflare-and-opendns-respond-differently-250511/)
European court orders target DNS resolvers to block piracy sites; OpenDNS suspends service, Cloudflare uses error pages, and Google refuses queries, raising transparency and legal compliance issues.

* Courts in France, Italy, and Belgium ordered OpenDNS, Cloudflare, and Google to modify DNS responses to block pirate sites.
* OpenDNS responded by suspending service in France and Belgium, effectively removing access for affected users.
* Cloudflare complies by redirecting users to HTTP 451 error pages without blocking content directly; Google refuses DNS queries, resulting in domain lookup failures.

### [Y Combinator Supports Antitrust Action Against Google for Open Competition](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205.1300.1.pdf)
Y Combinator’s amicus brief supports antitrust actions against Google, urging remedies that promote open competition, access to datasets, and prevent monopolistic extensions into AI and distribution channels.

* Y Combinator filed an amicus brief supporting plaintiffs in Google antitrust cases before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.
* The brief emphasizes the importance of open competition in innovation, citing Google’s conduct as limiting startup funding and opportunities.
* It advocates for forward-looking remedies, including access to Google’s datasets and search index, restrictions on extending monopolies into AI tools, preventing pay-to-play arrangements, and deterring circumvention and retaliation.

### [OpenAI and Microsoft Negotiate Contract Changes for Future IPO and AI Access](https://t.co/AGo0IHtJ4t)
OpenAI and Microsoft are negotiating contract revisions to facilitate OpenAI’s IPO, involving equity adjustments and extended access to AI models, amid tensions over profit motives and governance.

* OpenAI is negotiating with Microsoft to revise partnership terms to enable a future IPO and access new AI technology beyond 2030.
* The negotiations focus on Microsoft's equity stake in OpenAI’s restructured for-profit entity, with Microsoft potentially relinquishing some ownership for future access.
* The current contract from 2019, running until 2030, includes access to intellectual property and revenue sharing; negotiations aim to modify these terms to support OpenAI’s restructuring and funding needs.

### [Avoid Premature Microservices: Start with Monoliths to Boost Developer Velocity](https://nexo.sh/posts/microservices-for-startups/)
Premature microservices impose significant operational and development costs; startups should prioritize monolithic architecture, optimize developer velocity, and only split services when clear pain points emerge.

* Premature microservices increase deployment complexity, local dev fragility, CI/CD duplication, cross-service coupling, observability overhead, and test fragmentation
* Well-structured monoliths simplify deployment, focus teams on core tasks, and avoid unnecessary complexity; example: Laravel-based real estate app scaled without microservices
* Microservices are beneficial primarily for workload isolation, divergent scalability needs, and different runtime requirements; example: Uber’s domain-oriented architecture
* Common early pitfalls include arbitrary service boundaries, repository sprawl, broken local development environments, technology mismatch, and hidden communication/monitoring complexity
* Recommendations: start monolithic with single repo, simple local setup, invest early in CI/CD, split surgically based on real bottlenecks, and only adopt microservices when justified by scaling or organizational needs
