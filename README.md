## Notes To Myself

- The theme is included as a Git submodule. Remember to clone/pull it.
    ```shell
    git clone --recurse-submodules
    git pull --recurse-submodules
    ```

- Based on Hugo. Spawn a dev server at http://localhost:1313/ with:
    ```shell
    hugo server -D
    ```

- In Code, enable "Markdown Preview Enhanced" preview: Cmd+k v
