has significantly evolved by enabling live configuration changes, improving service consistency, reducing costs, and enhancing security, with key updates including EC2 live migration, S3 read-after-write, Lambda up to 15 minutes, and transition from RIs to Savings Plans.</p><ul><li>AWS EC2 now allows changing security groups and IAM roles without instance shutdown, supports resizing, attaching, or detaching EBS volumes on running instances, and can force stop or terminate instances without waiting for clean shutdowns.</li><li>EC2 supports live migration between physical hosts, reducing instance degradation notices; spot instances have shifted from bidding wars to gradual capacity shifts; AMI Block Public Access is default for new accounts.</li><li>S3 now provides read-after-write consistency, default encryption at rest, Block Public Access enabled by default on new buckets, and deprecates ACLs.</li><li>Networking improvements include the end of EC2-Classic, public IPv4 addresses costing as much as Elastic IPs, better options for VPC peering (Transit Gateway, VPC sharing, Cloud WAN), and support for security groups on Network Load Balancers.</li><li>CloudFront updates reduce deployment update time from ~45 minutes to ~5 minutes; ALB charges now exclude cross-AZ data transfer fees; availability zones can be aligned across accounts using Resource Access Manager.</li><li>Lambda now supports up to 15-minute execution, Docker container images, shared EFS storage, up to 10GB RAM, and faster VPC invocation; cold-start issues are reduced.</li><li>EFS allows separate adjustment of IO performance and capacity; EBS volumes now offer full performance when empty, with initial slow read from snapshots, and support multiple attachments with io1 volumes.</li><li>DynamoDB supports empty fields, improved performance reliability, and recommends running on-demand capacity unless specific needs dictate otherwise.</li><li>Cost management shifts from Reserved Instances to Savings Plans, with EC2 now billed by the second; Cost Anomaly Detector and Compute Optimizer provide enhanced cost and performance insights.</li><li>IAM roles are recommended for permissions, IAM users for legacy apps, and IAM Identity Center replaces AWS SSO; root account MFA can have multiple devices, and root credentials are unnecessary for organization members.</li><li>AWS service durability has improved, with outages now noteworthy rather than routine; deprecations are increasing, and CloudWatch data consistency issues are resolved;
