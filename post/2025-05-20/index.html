making games in 2025 without large engines, using C# with SDL3, FMOD, Dear ImGui, and open-source libraries, emphasizing control, portability, and longevity.</p><ul><li>Noel Berry has been making games for 20 years, emphasizing development without commercial engines like Unity or Unreal.</li><li>Uses C# with dotnet&rsquo;s hot reload, reflection, and modern features for cross-platform, high-performance game development.</li><li>Relies on libraries such as SDL3 for windowing, input, rendering, and FMOD for audio; writes custom layers and tools, often utilizing Dear ImGui for editors.</li><li>Supports porting to major platforms via SDL3&rsquo;s console ports and SDL3&rsquo;s GPU abstraction, with C# code compiled using Native-AOT for console compatibility.</li><li>Has transitioned to Linux for development, citing frustrations with Windows and advocating open-source, cross-platform tools.</li><li>Prefers small, custom tools over large engines, citing control, simplicity, and longevity; uses open-source frameworks like Love2D, FNA, and SDL.</li><li>Implements asset management by loading files at startup or on demand, with simple preprocessing scripts; creates custom level editors with Dear ImGui.</li><li>For 3D or advanced tech, considers rolling own frameworks or using Unreal, depending on project needs; highlights making stylized, less tech-dependent games.</li><li>Advocates for smaller teams or solo developers to build tailored workflows, reducing reliance on proprietary engines and promoting open-source solutions.</li><li>Uses
