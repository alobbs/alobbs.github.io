href=https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-indexes-trillions-of-messages>Discord&rsquo;s Search System Revolutionized with Kubernetes and Smaller Elasticsearch Clusters</a></h3><p>Discord&rsquo;s new search infrastructure, utilizing Kubernetes, smaller Elasticsearch clusters, PubSub, and shard reindexing, indexes trillions of messages with improved performance, scalability, and resilience.</p><ul><li>Discord&rsquo;s message search system, built in 2017, used Elasticsearch with messages sharded by guild or DM across two clusters.</li><li>Infrastructure issues included Redis message queue drops during Elasticsearch node failures, bulk indexing failures due to node failures, and large indices exceeding Lucene&rsquo;s ~2 billion message limit.</li><li>System scaling challenges involved high overhead in large clusters (>200 nodes), difficulty performing rolling upgrades, and large guild indices causing indexing and query performance issues.</li><li>Transition to Kubernetes deployment with Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK) enabled automated upgrades and safer rolling restarts.</li><li>Implemented a multi-cluster &ldquo;cell&rdquo; architecture with smaller, dedicated Elasticsearch clusters per cell, each with dedicated ingest, master, and data nodes, distributed across zones for resilience.</li><li>Switched message queue from Redis to Google Cloud PubSub for guaranteed delivery and backlog handling.</li><li>Batch messages by cluster and index before bulk indexing, using a PubSub message router with Tokio tasks to group messages by destination, improving fault tolerance.</li><li>Introduced &ldquo;cells&rdquo; of Elasticsearch clusters to support cross-DM search by sharding messages by user ID into separate <code>user-dm-messages</code> cells.</li><li>Created dedicated Elasticsearch clusters with multiple primary shards for &ldquo;Big Freaking Guilds&rdquo; (BFGs) approaching Lucene&rsquo;s max doc limit, enabling scalable search for large guilds.</li><li>Reindexing BFGs involves dual indexing, creating larger indices with more shards, and switching query traffic after validation, maintaining continuous search availability.</li><li>Results include indexing trillions of messages, doubling throughput, reducing median query latency from 500ms to under 100ms, and managing 40 Elasticsearch clusters with thousands of indices, enabling automated upgrades and zero service impact.</li></ul><hr><h3 id=heading><a

African and Indian Ocean nations, will hold elections on June 23, 2025, after over three years of stalemate.</li><li>The election process is overseen by receiver Gowtamsingh Dabee, who appointed UK-based King’s Counsel Simon Davenport to chair the Nomination Committee, supported by three other UK barristers.</li><li>Concerns about potential interferences prompted Dabee to include measures
