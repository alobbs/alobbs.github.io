Infrastructure issues included Redis message queue drops during Elasticsearch node failures, bulk indexing failures due to node failures, and large indices exceeding Lucene’s ~2 billion message limit. System scaling challenges involved high overhead in large clusters (\u003e200 nodes), difficulty performing rolling upgrades, and large guild indices causing indexing and query performance issues. Transition to Kubernetes deployment with Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK) enabled automated upgrades and safer rolling restarts. Implemented a multi-cluster “cell” architecture with smaller, dedicated Elasticsearch clusters per cell, each with dedicated ingest, master, and data nodes, distributed across zones for resilience. Switched message queue from Redis to Google Cloud PubSub for guaranteed delivery and backlog handling. Batch messages by cluster and index before bulk indexing, using a PubSub message router with Tokio tasks to group messages by destination, improving fault tolerance. Introduced “cells” of Elasticsearch clusters to support cross-DM search by sharding messages by user ID into separate user-dm-messages cells. Created dedicated Elasticsearch clusters with multiple primary shards for “Big Freaking Guilds” (BFGs) approaching Lucene’s max doc limit, enabling scalable search for large guilds. Reindexing BFGs involves dual indexing, creating larger indices with more shards, and switching query traffic after validation, maintaining continuous search availability. Results include indexing trillions of messages, doubling throughput, reducing median query latency from 500ms to under 100ms, and managing 40 Elasticsearch clusters with thousands of indices, enabling automated upgrades and zero service impact. “NetEase CEO Steps Back as Company Shifts Strategy Away from Gaming” NetEase is restructuring leadership as CEO William Ding reduces involvement in gaming, signaling a strategic shift away from game development amid regulatory and market pressures.\nNetEase executives, including CEO William Ding, are stepping down amid strategic shifts, with Ding reducing his involvement in game development The company is pulling back from its gaming business to focus on other areas, reflecting a broader corporate restructuring The leadership changes follow a period of regulatory scrutiny and market challenges in China’s gaming industry CISA warns of risks after Oracle cloud data breach exposes customer credentials CISA issued an alert after Oracle’s cloud infrastructure was compromised, exposing customer credentials and emphasizing the need for password resets, log monitoring, and MFA.\nCISA issued an alert regarding Oracle’s public cloud data breach, advising credential management and security measures.

Microsoft shifted from paid upgrades to Windows as a Service starting with Windows 10 in 2015, offering free upgrades from Windows 7, 8, and 8.1, and introducing telemetry and in-OS ads. The transition aimed to increase user engagement, data collection, and subscription revenue, while addressing declining PC sales and piracy; Windows 10 deployment included stealth downloads and suggested apps. Securing GenAI Requires Governance, Technology, and Data Protection Security leaders should adopt a comprehensive, evolving framework combining governance, technology controls, and data security to mitigate GenAI risks and ensure responsible AI use.\nSecurity leaders must adopt a strategic framework integrating governance, technology controls, and data protection for GenAI security. Establish a governance framework with cross-functional committees, ethical use policies, impact assessments, and ongoing training. Implement anticipatory controls including secure deployment, logging, access controls, cryptographic hashing, third-party vetting, and real-time discovery of unapproved AI tools. Strengthen data access with granular identity security, multi-factor authentication, data encryption, and monitoring of input/output data for privacy and bias. Use comprehensive identity security tools such as Privileged Access Management (PAM), zero-trust frameworks, adaptive policies, and safeguards against adversarial attacks. Avoid pitfalls like shadow AI underestimation, over-reliance on AI outputs, incomplete access controls, and supply chain oversight. Continuous evolution of security posture is necessary to mitigate risks while harnessing AI’s transformative potential. More information at delinea.com.

Perplexity’s New Browser Aims to Challenge Google Perplexity plans to release Comet, a browser designed to build AI agents capable of accessing third-party services, challenging Google’s dominance and expanding distribution through OEM partnerships like Motorola.\nAravind Srinivas, CEO of Perplexity, aims to challenge Google by integrating AI assistants into browsers and preinstalling on Android via partnerships like Motorola. Plans to release the Perplexity browser, Comet, in May 2025, leveraging it as a containerized OS to access third-party services, scrape pages, and perform reasoning. Perplexity has grown from 1 million to nearly 30 million monthly active users, handling approximately 600 million queries per month (~14% of Google’s volume); raised hundreds of millions at an $18 billion valuation. Secured distribution deal with Motorola for pre-installation on Razr phones, capitalizing on antitrust scrutiny on Google; aims to expand to OEMs and develop versions for Mac and Windows. The assistant on iOS uses Apple EventKit SDK for limited app control (Reminders, Podcasts, Apple Music, Maps) without special permissions; focuses on deep linking and client-side actions. Srinivas emphasizes building a browser as a platform for building AI agents, enabling access to third-party services, client-side scraping, and reasoning, viewing it as the final frontier beyond OS-level control. Discussed challenges with publishers over scraping content, now respecting robots.txt and using third-party data sources; plans to continue refining publisher relations. Raises funds to develop frontier reasoning models, aiming to reduce costs and expand user base, with a focus on collecting data to improve models and personalization. Mentioned ongoing efforts to acquire TikTok, citing control over algorithms and decoupling challenges; sees the browser as key to cross-platform context and memory for personalized AI. Srinivas predicts the OS will be the ultimate battleground, with the browser as a critical step toward owning the user environment and actions on the web and mobile.

with improved performance, scalability, and resilience.</p><ul><li>Discord&rsquo;s message search system, built in 2017, used Elasticsearch with messages sharded by guild or DM across two clusters.</li><li>Infrastructure issues included Redis message queue drops during Elasticsearch node failures, bulk indexing failures due to node failures, and large indices exceeding Lucene&rsquo;s ~2 billion message limit.</li><li>System scaling challenges involved high overhead in large clusters (>200 nodes), difficulty performing rolling upgrades, and large guild indices causing indexing and query performance issues.</li><li>Transition to Kubernetes deployment with Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK) enabled automated upgrades and safer rolling restarts.</li><li>Implemented a multi-cluster &ldquo;cell&rdquo; architecture with smaller, dedicated Elasticsearch clusters per cell, each with dedicated ingest, master, and data nodes, distributed across zones for resilience.</li><li>Switched message queue from Redis to Google Cloud PubSub for guaranteed delivery and backlog handling.</li><li>Batch messages by cluster and index before bulk indexing, using a PubSub message router with Tokio tasks to group messages by destination, improving fault tolerance.</li><li>Introduced &ldquo;cells&rdquo; of Elasticsearch clusters to support cross-DM search by sharding messages by user ID into separate <code>user-dm-messages</code> cells.</li><li>Created dedicated Elasticsearch clusters with multiple primary shards for &ldquo;Big Freaking Guilds&rdquo; (BFGs) approaching Lucene&rsquo;s max doc limit, enabling scalable search for large guilds.</li><li>Reindexing BFGs involves dual indexing, creating larger indices with more shards, and switching query traffic after validation, maintaining continuous search availability.</li><li>Results include indexing trillions of messages, doubling throughput, reducing median query latency from 500ms to under 100ms, and managing 40 Elasticsearch clusters with thousands of indices, enabling automated upgrades and zero service impact.</li></ul><hr><h3 id=heading><a
