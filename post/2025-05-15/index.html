Industry-Wide Progress Slowdown</a></h3><p>Meta is delaying its &ldquo;Behemoth&rdquo; AI model&rsquo;s release due to performance challenges, reflecting industry-wide delays in advancing state-of-the-art large-language models, with potential management changes.</p><ul><li>Meta delays the release of its large-language model &ldquo;Behemoth,&rdquo; originally scheduled for April, now expected in fall or later due to performance issues.</li><li>Internal concerns arise over whether improvements over previous versions justify public release; staff questions the model&rsquo;s capabilities.</li><li>Meta&rsquo;s AI development faces challenges similar to other top AI firms, with delays at OpenAI&rsquo;s GPT-5 and Anthropic&rsquo;s Claude 3.5 Opus, indicating a slowdown in AI progress.</li><li>Meta&rsquo;s &ldquo;Behemoth&rdquo; was intended to outperform competitors like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic but is hindered by training difficulties; management may undergo significant changes.</li><li>The company has publicly claimed &ldquo;Behemoth&rdquo; surpasses rivals on some tests, but internal performance has been hampered, reflecting broader industry delays and increased costs.</li></ul></article></div></div></div></div></div></div></main></div><script type=application/javascript src=https://alobbs.com/js/toc.js></script><link rel=stylesheet
