conversation can cost $50-$100 in tokens.</li><li>Successful production agents rely on bounded, verifiable operations with human oversight, not on fully autonomous, multi-step workflows.</li><li>Tool design is critical; effective feedback interfaces, partial failure handling, and structured responses are essential for reliability.</li><li>Integration with complex, legacy enterprise systems involves traditional systems programming, not just AI orchestration.</li><li>Practical, reliable agents operate within strict boundaries, with humans maintaining control over critical decisions and error recovery.</li><li>Predictions indicate that fully autonomous startups will face economic and reliability challenges, while domain-specific, constrained tools will succeed.</li><li>Building
