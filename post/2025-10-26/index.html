id=linux-boot-sequence-from-cpu-reset-to-kernel-initialization-and-security-features><a href=https://www.0xkato.xyz/linux-boot/>Linux Boot Sequence: From CPU Reset to Kernel Initialization and Security Features</a></h3><p>The Linux boot process involves CPU real mode startup, firmware (BIOS/UEFI) initialization, bootloader loading, setup execution, mode switching to 64-bit long mode with paging, kernel decompression, relocation, and optional address randomization for security.</p><ul><li>The Linux boot process begins with CPU reset to real mode at address 0xFFFFFFF0, executing a jump to firmware.</li><li>BIOS performs POST, checks boot devices for 512-byte boot sector ending with 0x55AA, and loads it at 0x7C00; UEFI replaces BIOS with direct filesystem access.</li><li>The bootloader (e.g., GRUB) loads the Linux kernel, which contains a setup program and compressed kernel; setup creates a predictable workspace, clears BSS, configures segment registers, and queries RAM via e820.</li><li>The setup code calls <code>main</code> in real mode, then switches to protected mode by disabling interrupts, opening A20 line, loading GDT/IDT, and setting CR0.PE, transitioning to 32-bit mode.</li><li>To run in 64-bit long mode, the kernel enables paging with identity mappings, sets LME in EFER, and performs a far return into 64-bit code, establishing virtual address translation.</li><li>The decompression stage unpacks the kernel ELF, applies relocations if loaded at a non-default address, and jumps to <code>start_kernel</code>.</li><li>Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (kASLR) randomly chooses physical and virtual base addresses from free memory regions, unless disabled with <code>nokaslr</code>, enhancing security.</li></ul><hr><h3
