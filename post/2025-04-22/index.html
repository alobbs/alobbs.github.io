The project, contracted by Washtenaw County, aims to wire approximately 596 addresses across four townships, adding 38 miles of fiber to his existing 14-mile network. The county allocated $71 million for broadband infrastructure, with Mauch’s project being one of four selected through a competitive RFP process that prioritized wireline speeds of at least 100 Mbps symmetrical. Mauch’s service costs $55/month for 100 Mbps unlimited, and $79/month for 1 Gbps, with a typical installation fee of $199. The project must be completed by the end of 2026, but Mauch aims to finish half by the end of 2023. Previously, he faced high costs from major providers—Comcast demanded $50,000 for line extension, and AT&amp;T offered only 1.5 Mbps DSL. Mauch also provides free 250 Mbps service to a local church and fiber backhaul to cell towers. His network management has been stable, with traffic around 500 Mbps, scalable to 4 Gbps. The expansion is part of a broader effort by Washtenaw County to connect over 3,000 households, with a focus on underserved, lower-income areas.</p><hr><h3 id=botnet-part-2-the-web-is-broken---jan-wildeboers-blog><a href=https://jan.wildeboer.net/2025/04/Web-is-Broken-Botnet-Part-2/>Botnet Part 2: The Web is Broken - Jan Wildeboer’s Blog</a></h3><h3 id=key-facts-2>Key Facts</h3><ul><li>Companies like Infatica monetize network bandwidth via SDKs embedded in iOS, Android, MacOS, and Windows apps, enabling web crawling and scraping using infected devices.</li><li>These SDKs sell access to millions of residential, static, and mobile IP addresses, facilitating large-scale AI web scraping and brute-force attacks.</li><li>Trend Micro&rsquo;s 2023 research confirms malicious repacking of freeware/shareware to conduct drive-by downloads of these proxy services, contributing to increased bot traffic and server overloads.</li></ul><h3 id=summary-2>Summary</h3><p>Jan Wildeboer highlights the proliferation of shady business models where app developers embed SDKs, such as Infatica’s, into their applications to monetize users’ network bandwidth. These SDKs enable the creation of botnets that leverage infected devices to perform web crawling, brute-force mail server attacks, and AI-driven web scraping, often using millions of residential, static, and mobile IP addresses. Trend Micro’s 2023 investigation confirms malicious repacking of freeware/shareware to facilitate drive-by downloads of these proxy services, exacerbating botnet activity. Wildeboer argues that this business model effectively causes DDoS-like traffic surges, impacting small web services and increasing the difficulty for server administrators to detect and block such malicious activity. He advocates that all web scraping should be considered abusive and recommends blocking such traffic, emphasizing that inclusion of SDKs for profit in apps makes developers complicit in malware distribution and botnet formation. The market for residential proxies, driven by AI web scraping demands, is expanding rapidly, with many providers relying on SDK injection into third-party apps. Wildeboer concludes that this trend undermines the web’s foundational integrity, urging webmasters and admins to remain vigilant against these evolving threats.</p><hr><h3 id=whistleblower-doge-siphoned-nlrb-case-data--krebs-on-security><a href=https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/04/whistleblower-doge-siphoned-nlrb-case-data/>Whistleblower: DOGE Siphoned NLRB Case Data – Krebs on Security</a></h3><h3 id=key-facts-3>Key Facts</h3><ul><li>A whistleblower from the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) alleges that DOGE employees transferred gigabytes of sensitive case data in early March using short-lived accounts with restricted logging.</li><li>The data exfiltration involved approximately 10 GB from the NxGen case management system, with suspicious activity including creation of high-privilege accounts and use of containers to obfuscate activity.</li><li>The whistleblower reports blocked login attempts from a Russian IP address shortly after account creation, along with unauthorized download of code libraries used for web scraping and brute-force attacks.

Berulis, alleges that employees from Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) siphoned sensitive case data in early March by creating high-privilege accounts with logging restrictions and using containerized environments to conceal activities. The incident involved transferring approximately 10 GB of data from the NxGen system, which contains confidential information on unions, legal cases, and corporate secrets. Suspicious activity included multiple blocked login attempts from a Russian IP address (83.149.30.186) shortly after account creation, with attempts to use valid credentials, and the download of code libraries designed for web scraping and brute-force attacks from GitHub. Berulis observed that network logs for recent resources went missing, and Microsoft Azure monitoring was turned off during the incident. Despite raising alarms and reporting to US-CERT, the NLRB was allegedly ordered to halt further investigation, and control over its systems was later revoked from staff. The whistleblower’s disclosures, supported by internal documentation and expert review, highlight potential security breaches involving high-level access and covert data exfiltration, amid broader political tensions and legal disputes involving Musk’s companies and government agencies.</p><hr><h3 id=an-intro-to-deepseek><a href=https://maknee.github.io/blog/2025/3FS-Performance-Journal-1/>An Intro to DeepSeek&rsquo;s Distributed File System | Some blog</a></h3><h3 id=key-facts-4>Key Facts</h3><ul><li>3FS (Fire-Flyer File System) is an open-source distributed filesystem released by DeepSeek on April 15, 2025</li><li>Core components include Meta, Mgmtd, Storage, and Client nodes, with Mgmtd managing node registration and cluster configuration</li><li>Utilizes CRAQ (Chain Replication with Apportioned Queries) protocol for strong consistency, with write throughput limited by the slowest node in the chain and performance affected by workload types</li></ul><h3 id=summary-4>Summary</h3><p>DeepSeek introduced <a href=https://github.com/deepseek-ai/3FS>3FS</a>, a distributed filesystem designed to abstract data across multiple machines, enabling applications to interact with it as if it were a local filesystem. It consists of four primary node types: Meta (manages file metadata stored in inodes and DirEntries within FoundationDB), Mgmtd (controls cluster configuration and node health via heartbeats and node discovery), Storage (handles physical data chunks using a Rust-based ChunkEngine, with metadata stored in LevelDB), and Client (interfaces with other nodes for file operations and data transfer). The system employs CRAQ for fault-tolerant, strongly consistent data replication, where write operations propagate from head to tail nodes, marking entries as &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; until committed, with read operations querying the tail for the most recent clean data. CRAQ&rsquo;s performance varies with workload, offering scalable, low-latency reads but higher write latency, especially under zipfian access patterns. The architecture emphasizes fault tolerance, scalability, and simplicity, with detailed design notes available <a href=https://github.com/deepseek-ai/3FS/blob/ee9a5cee0a85c64f4797bf380257350ca1becd36/docs/design_notes.md>here</a>. Future analyses aim to benchmark 3FS performance, evaluate bottlenecks, and compare it with other distributed filesystems.</p><hr><h3 id=update-on-spain-and-laliga-blocks-of-the-internet---vercel><a href=https://vercel.com/blog/update-on-spain-and-laliga-blocks-of-the-internet>Update on Spain and LALIGA blocks of the internet - Vercel</a></h3><h3 id=key-facts-5>Key Facts</h3><ul><li>Spanish court authorized LALIGA to block IP addresses associated with unauthorized football streaming, affecting Vercel infrastructure since December 2024.</li><li>IP addresses <code>66.33.60.129</code> and <code>76.76.21.142</code> are no longer blocked as of April 18, 2025, following Vercel&rsquo;s cooperation to remove illegal content.</li><li>Broad IP-wide blocks are enforced during LALIGA matchdays, impacting legitimate websites and services that share IP addresses, with no distinction between infringing and lawful content.</li></ul><h3 id=summary-5>Summary</h3><p>A Spanish court granted LALIGA authority in December 2024 to require ISPs, including Movistar, Vodafone, and Orange, to block IP addresses linked to unauthorized football streaming, a ruling upheld in March 2025. Enforcement has expanded to affect Vercel-hosted sites, resulting in indiscriminate IP blocking that impacts legitimate services such as Tinybird and Hello Magazine, which operate on shared IPs like <code>66.33.60.129</code> and <code>76.76.21.142</code>. Unlike targeted domain blocking via SNI inspection, ISPs are blocking entire IP ranges without differentiation, causing collateral damage to infrastructure, developers, and businesses during LALIGA matchdays. Vercel actively monitors and removes illegal content, maintaining a zero-tolerance policy, and is working with LALIGA to mitigate the impact. The company advocates for targeted, transparent enforcement and is exploring strategies to restore access for affected users in Spain, emphasizing the importance of an open, permissionless web.</p><h2 id=-open-source>▶️ Open Source</h2><h3 id=15000-lines-of-verified-cryptography-now-in-python--jonathan-protzenko><a href=http://jonathan.protzenko.fr/2025/04/18/python.html>15,000 lines of verified cryptography now in Python | Jonathan Protzenko</a></h3><h3 id=key-facts-6>Key Facts</h3><ul><li>Python&rsquo;s hash and HMAC algorithms are now fully implemented using <a href=https://github.com/project-everest/hacl-star/>HACL*</a>, a verified cryptographic library, replacing previous implementations.</li><li>The transition, completed after 2.5 years of work, includes 15,000 lines of verified C code integrated into Python without loss of functionality.</li><li>Upstream updates from HACL* are automated via a script, ensuring maintainability and consistency.</li></ul><h3 id=summary-6>Summary</h3><p>Python has integrated <a href=https://github.com/project-everest/hacl-star/>HACL*</a>, a verified cryptographic library, to implement all default hash and HMAC algorithms, following a GitHub issue opened in November 2022 addressing cryptographic verification after a SHA3 CVE. This integration adds approximately 15,000 lines of verified C code, enabling features such as additional Blake2 modes, a comprehensive SHA3 API covering all Keccak variants, strict abstraction patterns for build system compatibility, proper error handling including allocation failures, and optimized HMAC implementations maintaining two hash states simultaneously. The process involved extensive low-level technical work, including generic streaming API verification using dependent types, handling complex buffer management, and refactoring C code to abstract structs for compatibility with older compilers. The build system&rsquo;s CI coverage uncovered corner cases, notably with AVX2-specific code, requiring careful refactoring to ensure cross-platform compatibility. Memory allocation failures are now propagated through the verification framework via <code>option</code> types, enhancing robustness. Upstream HACL* updates are managed through a shell script that fetches, refines, and integrates code changes, simplifying maintenance. This milestone demonstrates verified cryptography&rsquo;s maturity and readiness for real-world deployment in critical software like Python.</p><hr><h3 id=a-new-form-of-verification-on-bluesky---bluesky><a href=https://bsky.social/about/blog/04-21-2025-verification>A New Form of Verification on Bluesky - Bluesky</a></h3><h3 id=key-facts-7>Key Facts</h3><ul><li>Bluesky introduces a new, user-friendly blue check for verified accounts, launched on April 21, 2025</li><li>Over 270,000 accounts linked their domain as their username since the 2023 launch of domain handle verification</li><li>Verified accounts now display a blue check, with additional verification via trusted verifiers—organizations that can directly issue blue checks, marked by scalloped blue checks</li></ul><h3 id=summary-7>Summary</h3><p>Bluesky announced a new verification layer on April 21, 2025, featuring a recognizable blue check to indicate authentic and notable accounts. Building on the initial domain handle verification launched in 2023, which linked over 270,000 accounts to their websites, the platform now offers a visual trust signal through a blue check. This check is issued either automatically for verified accounts or through trusted verifiers—organizations like The New York Times that can directly verify accounts within the app, with moderation reviews ensuring authenticity. When users tap on a verified account&rsquo;s blue check, they can see which organization granted the verification. Users can also hide verification signals via Settings. Self-verification remains encouraged by setting a domain as the username; however, Bluesky is not accepting direct verification applications during this phase. Future plans include a request form for notable accounts and trusted verifiers once the feature stabilizes. The initiative aims to enhance trust and authenticity in decentralized social conversations, aligning with Bluesky’s broader goal of transitioning the social web from platform-centric to protocol-based systems.</p><hr><h3 id=i-left-spotify-what-happened-next><a href=https://coppolaemilio.com/entries/i-left-spotify-what-happened-next/>I left Spotify.

It illustrates configuring a key to run <code>/usr/local/sbin/rrsync -ro /path/</code> to restrict an SSH session to a read-only rsync operation, enhancing security for database backup transfers. The author demonstrates managing multiple tasks by adding separate SSH keys with different command directives, such as initiating a script to pull database backups from another host. The setup involves specifying the <code>from</code> attribute to restrict access to particular hosts and embedding the command directly within the authorized_keys entry. The approach ensures that each SSH key is tied to a precise, limited operation, preventing unauthorized actions. The article emphasizes the importance of using distinct SSH keys for different tasks, simplifying access management and maintaining security boundaries for critical systems like database backups.</p><hr><h3 id=python><a href=https://davepeck.org/2025/04/11/pythons-new-t-strings/>Python&rsquo;s new t-strings | Dave Peck</a></h3><h3 id=key-facts-10>Key Facts</h3><ul><li>Python 3.14, featuring t-strings, will be released in late 2025</li><li>T-strings are a generalization of f-strings, evaluating to <code>string.templatelib.Template</code> objects</li><li>T-strings improve safety by requiring explicit processing before use, preventing injection vulnerabilities</li></ul><h3 id=summary-10>Summary</h3><p>Python&rsquo;s <a href=https://peps.python.org/pep-0750/>PEP 750</a> introduces t-strings (template strings) as a new feature in Python 3.14, arriving in late 2025. T-strings extend the capabilities of f-strings by evaluating to <code>string.templatelib.Template</code> objects rather than immediate strings, enabling safer and more flexible string processing. Unlike f-strings, which can be dangerously misused with user input (e.g., SQL injection or XSS), t-strings require explicit processing before conversion to a string, allowing developers to implement safe escaping functions such as <code>html()</code>. T-strings provide access to their components via <code>.strings</code> and <code>.values</code> properties, supporting complex manipulations and custom processing, including iteration and detailed interpolation analysis. They can be instantiated with literal syntax (<code>t"..."</code>) or directly through the <code>Template</code> constructor with <code>Interpolation</code> objects. An example demonstrates converting a template into pig Latin by processing each interpolation. The feature aims to enhance string safety and flexibility in Python libraries and frameworks, especially those handling user input, and is expected to influence tooling support like code formatters and IDEs.</p><hr><h3 id=defold---official-homepage---cross-platform-game-engine><a href=https://defold.com/>Defold - Official Homepage - Cross platform game engine</a></h3><h3 id=key-facts-11>Key Facts</h3><ul><li>Defold is a free, production-ready, cross-platform game engine supporting major platforms including PlayStation®5, PlayStation®4, Nintendo Switch, Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, Windows, Steam, HTML5, Facebook, and Q3 2024 XBox.</li><li>Comes fully featured out of the box with visual editor, code editor, Lua scripting, Lua debugger, scene, particle, tilemap editors, supporting both 2D and 3D development.</li><li>No setup required; offers zero-config cloud build, native code extension, and integration with tools like Atom, VS Code, Spine, TexturePacker, and Tiled.</li></ul><h3 id=summary-11>Summary</h3><p>Defold is a free, open-source, cross-platform game engine designed for high-performance game development, supporting platforms such as PlayStation®5, PlayStation®4, Nintendo Switch, Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, Windows, Steam, HTML5, Facebook, and expected Q3 2024 XBox release.

Prior to Python 3.7&rsquo;s <code>@dataclass</code>, developers resorted to complex alternatives like factory functions or attribute defaults, which had significant drawbacks. Using <code>__init__</code> for side-effect-laden setup, such as opening file descriptors in a <code>FileReader</code> class, introduces problems including reduced testability, increased complexity, and potential invalid object states. The proposed solution involves leveraging <code>@dataclass</code> to automatically generate attribute assignment, replacing <code>__init__</code> with <code>@classmethod</code> factory methods (e.g., <code>FileReader.open</code>) for flexible, asynchronous, or context-specific instantiation, and employing <code>typing.NewType</code> to enforce constraints on primitive types like file descriptors. This approach ensures objects are always valid, simplifies testing, and makes object creation more discoverable and future-proof, aligning with Python&rsquo;s idiomatic practices.</p><hr><h3 id=fossil-fuels-fall-below-50-of-us-electricity-for-the-first-month-on-record--ember><a href=https://ember-energy.org/latest-updates/fossil-fuels-fall-below-50-of-us-electricity-for-the-first-month-on-record/>Fossil fuels fall below 50% of US electricity for the first month on record | Ember</a></h3><h3 id=key-facts-25>Key Facts</h3><ul><li>In March 2025, fossil fuels accounted for 49.2% of US electricity, the first month below 50%, surpassing the previous record low of 51% in April 2024</li><li>Clean energy sources generated 50.8% of US electricity in March 2025, driven by record-high wind and solar power</li><li>Wind and solar reached a combined 24.4% of US electricity, with solar increasing 37% (+8.3 TWh) and wind increasing 12% (+5.7 TWh) compared to March 2024; total wind and solar generation hit 83 TWh, an 11% rise over April 2024</li></ul><h3 id=summary-25>Summary</h3><p>In March 2025, the US experienced a historic shift as fossil fuels contributed only 49.2% to electricity generation, marking the first month on record below the 50% threshold, according to Ember. This milestone reflects a long-term decline in fossil fuel reliance, with wind and solar power reaching a record 24.4% of the energy mix—solar alone increased by 37% (+8.3 TWh) and wind by 12% (+5.7 TWh) year-over-year. Combined, wind and solar generated 83 TWh, an 11% increase from April 2024, while fossil fuel generation decreased by 2.5% (-4.3 TWh). Since March 2015, when fossil fuels accounted for 65% and solar just 1%, the share of wind and solar has more than quadrupled, with solar expected to constitute over half of new US capacity in 2025. The rapid growth of renewable energy signifies a pivotal transition toward a cleaner power system, with wind and solar increasingly displacing coal and gas, and signals a potential approaching tipping point where clean energy surpasses fossil fuel reliance in the US electricity sector.

It addresses common challenges such as managing prompts, context windows, structured tool outputs, and control flow, advocating for ownership and modularity in these areas. The approach discourages building from scratch with full frameworks; instead, it recommends incorporating small, modular agent concepts into existing products to improve reliability, scalability, and maintainability. The twelve factors include transforming natural language into tool calls, owning prompts and context, unifying execution and business state, enabling simple APIs for launching and pausing agents, and designing small, focused agents that can trigger from anywhere and act as stateless reducers. The guide also discusses the historical evolution from DAG-based orchestrators to agent loops, highlighting the limitations of purely loop-based agent architectures. It emphasizes that core engineering techniques, rather than frameworks alone, are key to deploying effective AI agents in customer-facing environments. Additional resources and related frameworks are linked throughout, supporting developers in applying these principles across various languages and platforms.</p><hr><h3 id=things-zig-comptime-won><a href=https://matklad.github.io/2025/04/19/things-zig-comptime-wont-do.html>Things Zig comptime Won&rsquo;t Do</a></h3><h3 id=key-facts-28>Key Facts</h3><ul><li>Zig’s comptime is designed to be restrictive, preventing host architecture leakage, dynamic code evaluation (#eval), DSL creation, RTTI, API extension, and IO operations</li><li>Comptime code observes the target architecture, not the host, ensuring cross-compilation correctness</li><li>Zig lacks facilities for dynamic source code generation, custom syntax extension, runtime type information, and input/output during compilation</li></ul><h3 id=summary-28>Summary</h3><p>Zig’s compile-time evaluation (comptime) features are intentionally limited to maintain safety, portability, and simplicity. Comptime code executes in the target environment, not on the host machine, preventing host architecture leakage, as demonstrated by examples showing architecture-dependent behavior during cross-compilation. Zig does not support dynamic source code injection or evaluation (#eval), relying instead on partial evaluation and specialization, such as marking function parameters with <code>comptime</code> to generate optimized code paths. It also lacks support for custom syntax DSLs, as all code operates on Zig values, with embedded DSLs like <code>print</code> using format strings. Zig does not include runtime type information (RTTI), requiring users to implement manual reflection for dynamic data handling, exemplified by a custom <code>RTTI</code> union and <code>print_dyn</code> function. Additionally, Zig types cannot be extended with methods post-generation; API modifications are limited to reflection-based internal logic. Finally, Zig’s compile-time evaluation is hermetic, with no I/O capabilities, ensuring reproducibility and safety, though build systems can invoke external programs for code generation.</p><hr><h3 id=matthewsinclaircom--intelligence-innovation-leadership-influence><a href=https://matthewsinclair.com/blog/0178-why-llm-powered-programming-is-more-mech-suit-than-artificial-human>matthewsinclair.com · Intelligence.

The author built two applications totaling around 30,000 lines of code in weeks, demonstrating significant acceleration in development speed. These tools provide tremendous &ldquo;lifting power,&rdquo; but require developers to maintain constant vigilance, guiding the AI and correcting its often bewildering or biased decisions, similar to piloting an aircraft. The process shifts focus from coding to designing, reviewing, and maintaining architectural integrity, emphasizing the importance of experience and domain knowledge to recognize when AI output is flawed. The author highlights the &ldquo;centaur effect,&rdquo; where human-AI collaboration outperforms either alone, with AI handling pattern recognition and tactical execution, and humans providing strategic oversight. The article stresses that effective use of these tools demands new skills—particularly in delegation, ruthless discarding of suboptimal solutions, and clear problem understanding. While some fear AI will replace programmers, the author sees the future as augmentation, where mastery of AI tools becomes a core skill, transforming the role of developers into strategic operators of powerful systems. The key to success lies in balancing delegation with control, leveraging AI for speed while applying human judgment to ensure quality and direction.</p><hr><h3 id=tls-certificate-lifetimes-will-officially-reduce-to-47-days--digicert><a href=https://www.digicert.com/blog/tls-certificate-lifetimes-will-officially-reduce-to-47-days>TLS Certificate Lifetimes Will Officially Reduce to 47 Days | DigiCert</a></h3><h3 id=key-facts-30>Key Facts</h3><ul><li>CA/Browser Forum voted to reduce TLS certificate lifetime to 47 days, with implementation starting March 15, 2026</li><li>Maximum TLS certificate validity decreases from 398 days (current) to 200 days (2026), then to 100 days (2027), and finally to 47 days (2029)</li><li>Reuse period for domain/IP validation info drops from 398 days to 10 days by March 15, 2029; SII reuse in OV/EV certificates reduces from 825 days to 398 days</li></ul><h3 id=summary-30>Summary</h3><p>The CA/Browser Forum has officially amended the <a href=https://groups.google.com/a/groups.cabforum.org/g/servercert-wg/c/bvWh5RN6tYI>TLS Baseline Requirements</a> to progressively shorten TLS certificate lifetimes, with the maximum validity decreasing from 398 days to 47 days by March 15, 2029. The schedule begins with a reduction to 200 days in 2026, then to 100 days in 2027, and finally to 47 days in 2029. Concurrently, the reuse period for domain and IP address validation information will decline from 398 days to 10 days, and validation of Subject Identity Information (SII) in OV and EV certificates will be limited to 398 days, down from 825 days. The rationale emphasizes increased trustworthiness of certificate data and mitigates reliance on unreliable revocation systems like CRLs and OCSP. Apple justified the change by highlighting the necessity of automation for managing shorter-lived certificates, with DigiCert supporting this transition through solutions like <a href=https://www.digicert.com/trust-lifecycle-manager>Trust Lifecycle Manager</a> and <a href=https://www.digicert.com/tls-ssl/certcentral-tls-ssl-manager>CertCentral</a>, including ACME support for automated issuance and renewal.

She emphasizes that &ldquo;Technical&rdquo; operates outside of actual problem-solving, serving to uphold hierarchies, policing boundaries, and perpetuating systemic inequalities based on gender, race, class, and social location. Hicks highlights how the social and political context of tech creates unearned privileges and unwarranted exclusions, making it impossible for her to be recognized as legitimate within that framework despite her expertise in psychology and her impactful work. She critiques the hierarchical, hierarchical, and geo-located nature of tech, which maintains a culture of dehumanization and marginalization of those deemed &ldquo;not-Technical.&rdquo; Hicks advocates for recognizing the full humanity of all individuals, emphasizing that true work involves caring, safety, and community rather than perpetuating the &ldquo;hamster wheel&rdquo; of performance and exclusion. She calls for a space of rehumanization and honest conversation about the systemic issues within tech, emphasizing that &ldquo;Technical&rdquo; is a social construct that cannot be earned or bestowed but is maintained through systemic reinforcement.

Key issues include tariffs being too low to offset higher U.S. production costs, as manufacturing in the U.S. remains more expensive than in Asia even with tariffs. The U.S. supply chain for industrial components is weak, relying heavily on Asian factories, making local production uncompetitive. The country lacks essential manufacturing knowhow, such as moldmaking and semiconductor fabrication, which cannot be quickly or easily developed. Labor costs in the U.S. are higher not only due to wages but also because of lower productivity, work ethic, and infrastructure quality compared to China. Infrastructure deficits, including electricity generation and transportation networks, further hinder manufacturing revival. The lengthy process to build and operationalize new factories (minimum two years) and the uncertainty caused by fluctuating tariffs discourage investment. Complex and inconsistent tariff enforcement, along with a litigious business environment, exacerbate risks. The policy risks causing a recession, as supply chain disruptions and increased costs lead to inflation or deflation. The article predicts that unless policies change, globalization will bypass the U.S., with manufacturing shifting to countries like Vietnam and Mexico. To genuinely rebuild manufacturing, the U.S. must address fundamental social, infrastructural, and educational issues, implement gradual tariff increases, and incentivize high-end production, rather than relying solely on tariffs.</p><hr><h3 id=decreased-co2-saturation-during-circular-breathwork-supports-emergence-of-altered-states-of-consciousness--communications-psychology><a href=https://www.nature.com/articles/s44271-025-00247-0>Decreased CO2 saturation during circular breathwork supports emergence of altered states of consciousness | Communications Psychology</a></h3><h3 id=key-facts-33>Key Facts</h3><ul><li>Circular breathwork induces significant reductions in end-tidal CO2 pressure (etCO2), with active participants reaching levels as low as 10–20 mmHg, compared to 36.7 ± 1.5 mmHg in non-hyperventilating controls</li><li>Decreases in etCO2 are significantly correlated with the onset and depth of altered states of consciousness (ASCs), resembling psychedelic experiences across domains such as ego dissolution and unity</li><li>Both Holotropic and Conscious-Connected breathwork produce similar physiological and experiential outcomes, with session durations of approximately 3 hours and 1.5 hours respectively, engaging the same mechanisms</li></ul><h3 id=summary-33>Summary</h3><p>This study demonstrates that circular breathwork, involving deliberate hyperventilation, can reliably trigger altered states of consciousness (ASCs) akin to those produced by psychedelics, with experience scales (MEQ30 and 11D-ASC) reaching levels comparable to moderate doses of psilocybin, LSD, and MDMA. Physiologically, active participants exhibited a marked reduction in end-tidal CO2 (etCO2), dropping to as low as 10–20 mmHg, which was strongly associated with ASC onset (<em>r</em> = -0.46 to -0.47, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.01). These reductions in CO2 pressure, supported by prior hyperventilation research, appear to serve as a physiological trigger for ASC emergence, with lower etCO2 levels (&lt;35 mmHg) virtually guaranteeing profound experiences when falling below 20 mmHg. The experiential depth correlated with physiological changes and persisted even as etCO2 levels normalized, suggesting a transition into a neuronal state of heightened perception, consistent with the concept of Pivotal Mental States. Both breathwork styles—Holotropic and Conscious-Connected—elicited similar physiological and subjective effects despite differences in session length, indicating shared underlying mechanisms. Post-session assessments revealed sustained improvements in well-being and reductions in depressive symptoms, with deeper ASC experiences predicting greater long-term benefits. Physiologically, breathwork caused a decrease in salivary alpha-amylase (sympathetic activity marker) and an increase in IL-1β (inflammatory marker), with subjective ASC depth inversely related to inflammation. These findings position breathwork as a non-pharmacological tool capable of inducing profound, psychedelic-like states through physiological modulation, with potential therapeutic applications supported by its safety profile and accessibility.</p><hr><h3 id=synology-lost-the-plot-with-hard-drive-locking-move---servethehome><a href=https://www.servethehome.com/synology-lost-the-plot-with-hard-drive-locking-move/>Synology Lost the Plot with Hard Drive Locking Move - ServeTheHome</a></h3><h3 id=key-facts-34>Key Facts</h3><ul><li>Synology plans to restrict its 2025 Plus NAS models to use only its own branded hard drives</li><li>This move disables features like volume-wide deduplication, lifespan analysis, and automatic firmware updates for third-party drives</li><li>The new policy limits maximum raw capacity to 128TB in an 8-bay NAS, compared to 208TB with competing brands like QNAP and TrueNAS using third-party drives</li></ul><h3 id=summary-34>Summary</h3><p>Synology is moving towards vendor-locking its 2025 Plus series NAS devices to only support Synology-branded hard drives, a shift that restricts compatibility with third-party drives and disables features such as volume-wide deduplication, lifespan analysis, and automatic firmware updates for non-branded drives. This strategy appears to be driven by a desire to increase margins, as Synology’s current drives max out at 16TB (e.g., HAT3310-16T), whereas competitors like WD Red Pro and Toshiba N300 Pro offer drives up to 26TB. Locking drives limits data security options, as users cannot quickly replace failed drives with models from other vendors, which can delay rebuild times and compromise data safety. Additionally, long-term availability of Synology drives is uncertain, raising concerns about future replacements and ecosystem dependence. The move is viewed as a step back in hardware flexibility and could harm Synology’s reputation, especially given the aging hardware and limited hardware refresh cycles. Critics argue that this lock-in reduces consumer choice and may lead to higher costs, as Synology’s drives are priced higher and have slower delivery times compared to third-party options. The industry context shows that vendor lock-in strategies often backfire, and many users prefer building custom solutions or switching to open-source NAS platforms like TrueNAS.</p><h2 id=-technology>▶️ Technology</h2><h3 id=try-generating-video-in-gemini-powered-by-veo-2><a href=https://blog.google/products/gemini/video-generation/>Try generating video in Gemini, powered by Veo 2</a></h3><h3 id=key-facts-35>Key Facts</h3><ul><li>Google has introduced video generation features in Gemini, powered by Veo 2, available to Google One AI Premium subscribers.</li><li>Users can transform text prompts into high-resolution, eight-second videos at 720p in a 16:9 aspect ratio, with a monthly creation limit.</li><li>Additionally, Whisk Animate enables turning images into eight-second videos using Veo 2, accessible in over 60 countries.</li></ul><h3 id=summary-35>Summary</h3><p>Google has launched new video generation capabilities within the Gemini AI platform, utilizing the advanced Veo 2 model to produce high-resolution, cinematic-quality videos from text prompts.
