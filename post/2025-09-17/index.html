by NISTA due to resource concerns and delays, notably the September 2025 pilot completion.</li><li>The cost savings stem from outsourcing migration resources to Microsoft and other government departments, eliminating the need for Cabinet Office to develop its own platform.</li><li>The transition is critical due to the incompatibility of Google and Microsoft systems, which hampers collaboration within government and with external partners.</li><li>The initial migration pause was announced last year, with the Cabinet Office hiring Capgemini for £12-15 million to assist with the process.</li><li>The project’s delay and management issues highlight ongoing challenges in UK government digital transformation efforts.</li></ul><hr><h3 id=scale-ai-secures-41m-pentagon-deal-for-ai-data-labeling-and-top-secret-deployment><a href=https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/17/dod_scale_ai_deal/>Scale AI Secures $41M Pentagon Deal for AI Data Labeling and Top Secret Deployment</a></h3><p>Scale AI partnered with the Pentagon for a $41 million deal to provide data labeling, AI platform access, and models on Top Secret networks, enhancing AI&rsquo;s role in national security.</p><ul><li>Scale AI received a $41 million contract from the Pentagon for data labeling and AI application licensing, with a ceiling of $100 million over five years</li><li>The deal includes access to Scale&rsquo;s GenAI Platform, Donovan decision-making platform, and Data Engine for transforming raw sensitive data into AI-ready datasets</li><li>The contract enables AI deployment on Top Secret networks, aiming to bridge commercial AI innovation with classified military environments</li></ul><hr><h3 id=microsoft-copilot-boosts-productivity-but-struggles-to-prove-roi><a href=https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/17/return_on_investment_for_copilot/>Microsoft Copilot Boosts Productivity but Struggles to Prove ROI</a></h3><p>Microsoft acknowledges Copilot boosts productivity by 20-30% but struggles to prove clear ROI;
