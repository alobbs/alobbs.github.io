</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=gu></span>Simon Willison’s 2025 talk at the Bay Area AI Security Meetup detailed prompt injection vulnerabilities, the lethal trifecta framework, and security challenges in LLM systems, highlighting attack vectors, ineffective defenses, and the need for constrained input handling.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=k>*</span> Simon Willison presented on prompt injection, the lethal trifecta, and MCP security challenges at the Bay Area AI Security Meetup on August 9, 2025
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=k>*</span> Prompt injection, coined in September 2022, involves string concatenation vulnerabilities similar to SQL injection, enabling malicious prompts and data exfiltration
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=k>*</span> The lethal trifecta comprises private data access, untrusted content, and external communication, which together enable data theft and system compromise
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=k>*</span> Examples include Markdown exfiltration attacks using image URLs to leak private data and exploits on systems like GitHub MCP, Google DeepMind CaMeL, and others
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=k>*</span> Common defenses such as prompt begging and AI-based attack detection are ineffective against adversarial attempts; removing any one of the trifecta&#39;s legs can prevent attacks
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=k>*</span> The presentation emphasizes that security must constrain untrusted input to prevent consequential actions, referencing research like Google DeepMind&#39;s CaMeL and design patterns for secure LLM agents
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=k>*</span> The MCP system&#39;s current approach of user-configurable modules risks outsourcing critical security decisions, potentially enabling all three legs of the trifecta

</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=k>*</span> Meta&#39;s research prototype aims toward the &#34;Visual Turing Test,&#34; with plans for Tiramisu 2 to balance 60 PPD resolution, ~700 nits brightness, and a 90° field of view in a 26mm thick headset.
