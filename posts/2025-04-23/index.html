The joint letter to California and Delaware attorneys-general warns that the restructuring would transfer control of artificial general intelligence (AGI) development to a profit-driven entity, contradicting OpenAI’s founding mission to benefit all humanity. OpenAI aims to complete the for-profit conversion by the end of 2023 to secure additional investments, including a $30bn funding round from SoftBank, amid concerns that the change could undermine its mission and increase societal risks associated with AGI. Summary Former OpenAI staff and top AI researchers, including Geoffrey Hinton and Stuart Russell, have petitioned US authorities to block the company’s plan to convert from a non-profit to a for-profit public benefit corporation (PBC). They argue this shift would prioritize profit over the company’s original mission to ensure AGI benefits all humanity, risking increased societal and safety concerns. OpenAI, valued at $300bn and seeking to secure further investments, contends that the restructuring will strengthen its non-profit and align with its mission, but critics warn it could lead to loss of control over AGI development and heightened risks of misuse.\nA new, open source text-to-speech model called Dia has arrived to challenge ElevenLabs, OpenAI and more | VentureBeat Key Facts Nari Labs released Dia, a 1.6 billion parameter open-source TTS model, designed for naturalistic dialogue generation from text prompts Supports nuanced features like emotional tone, speaker tagging, nonverbal cues, and audio conditioning for voice cloning Model runs on PyTorch 2.0+ with CUDA 12.6, requiring ~10GB VRAM; inference on enterprise GPUs (~NVIDIA A4000) achieves ~40 tokens/sec Code and weights available on GitHub and Hugging Face; accessible via demo on Hugging Face Spaces Fully open source under Apache 2.0 license, permitting commercial use with restrictions on impersonation and misinformation; development supported by Google TPU Cloud and Hugging Face grants Summary Nari Labs introduced Dia, an open-source 1.6B parameter TTS model capable of producing highly natural dialogue with features like emotional tone, speaker tags, and nonverbal cues.

The potential sale of Chrome is linked to broader antitrust cases, including DOJ efforts to force Google to sell off parts of its business to reduce monopoly power.\n▶️ Management and Leadership Native visionOS platform support by rsanchezsaez · Pull Request #105628 · godotengine/godot · GitHub Key Facts This PR adds native support for the visionOS platform to Godot, using iOS as the base and reusing code via drivers/apple_embedded. Implements platform-specific logic, including app instantiation, display server, and export plugin, with no OpenGL support due to visionOS limitations. Renames export plugin files and shared configuration to accommodate both iOS and visionOS, and moves shared code into drivers/apple_embedded. Tests confirm native execution on visionOS with Metal renderer; DPI metrics are hardcoded, and icon asset support is pending. The PR is part of a three-step plan, with subsequent PRs planned for SwiftUI integration and immersive VR plugin support. Summary This PR introduces a native visionOS platform support for Godot, closely aligned with the existing iOS implementation. It refactors shared code into drivers/apple_embedded, renames relevant export and platform files, and disables OpenGL due to visionOS constraints. Testing with the Platformer demo confirms native execution using Metal, though DPI metrics are static and icon asset generation is incomplete. The contribution lays the groundwork for future immersive VR support and SwiftUI integration, with ongoing discussions about platform maintenance and compatibility considerations.\nMicrosoft just launched powerful AI ‘agents’ that could completely transform your workday – and challenge Google’s workplace dominance | VentureBeat Key Facts Microsoft announced the “Microsoft 365 Copilot Wave 2 Spring release” introducing AI agents with deep reasoning capabilities for workplace tasks.

They argue this shift would prioritize profit over the company&rsquo;s original mission to ensure AGI benefits all humanity, risking increased societal and safety concerns. OpenAI, valued at $300bn and seeking to secure further investments, contends that the restructuring will strengthen its non-profit and align with its mission, but critics warn it could lead to loss of control over AGI development and heightened risks of misuse.</p><hr><h3 id=a-new-open-source-text-to-speech-model-called-dia-has-arrived-to-challenge-elevenlabs-openai-and-more--venturebeat><a href=https://venturebeat.com/ai/a-new-open-source-text-to-speech-model-called-dia-has-arrived-to-challenge-elevenlabs-openai-and-more/>A new, open source text-to-speech model called Dia has arrived to challenge ElevenLabs, OpenAI and more | VentureBeat</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#a-new-open-source-text-to-speech-model-called-dia-has-arrived-to-challenge-elevenlabs-openai-and-more--venturebeat>#</a></h3><h3 id=key-facts-5>Key Facts<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#key-facts-5>#</a></h3><ul><li>Nari Labs released Dia, a 1.6 billion parameter open-source TTS model, designed for naturalistic dialogue generation from text prompts</li><li>Supports nuanced features like emotional tone, speaker tagging, nonverbal cues, and audio conditioning for voice cloning</li><li>Model runs on PyTorch 2.0+ with CUDA 12.6, requiring ~10GB VRAM; inference on enterprise GPUs (~NVIDIA A4000) achieves ~40 tokens/sec</li><li>Code and weights available on <a href=https://github.com/nari-labs/dia>GitHub</a> and <a href=https://huggingface.co/nari-labs/Dia-1.6B>Hugging Face</a>; accessible via demo on Hugging Face Spaces</li><li>Fully open source under Apache 2.0 license, permitting commercial use with restrictions on impersonation and misinformation; development supported by Google TPU Cloud and Hugging Face grants</li></ul><h3 id=summary-5>Summary<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#summary-5>#</a></h3><p>Nari Labs introduced Dia, an open-source 1.6B parameter TTS model capable of producing highly natural dialogue with features like emotional tone, speaker tags, and nonverbal cues.
