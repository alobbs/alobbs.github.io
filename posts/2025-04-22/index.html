The implementation addresses complex streaming API requirements for block algorithms, ensuring safe, generic, and verified handling of various cryptographic modes and states, including optimized HMAC with dual hash states. Summary In November 2022, Jonathan Protzenko proposed replacing Python’s hash infrastructure with verified cryptography after a CVE in SHA3. As of April 2025, Python now vendors HACL*, a verified cryptographic library, for all default hash and HMAC algorithms, integrating 15,000 lines of verified C code. This transition was seamless for users and involved automating updates from upstream HACL*.\nThe integration required extensive technical work, including implementing new features such as additional Blake2 modes, a comprehensive SHA3 API covering all Keccak variants, and robust error handling, notably for memory allocation failures. The process involved developing a generic, formally verified streaming API for block algorithms using dependent types, accommodating diverse algorithm-specific requirements like pre-input data, variable output lengths, and state retention.\nHandling build complexities, especially with platform-specific optimizations like AVX2 instructions, necessitated refactoring C code to use abstract structs, which was complicated by the auto-generated nature of the code from F* via krml. The project also incorporated rigorous CI testing across 50+ toolchains and architectures, revealing and addressing corner cases such as AVX2-dependent code in HMAC.\nMemory failure propagation was achieved by integrating option types into the verification model, enabling failure detection and propagation through the cryptographic stack. Upstream updates from HACL* are now manageable via a shell script, simplifying maintenance.\nThis large-scale integration demonstrates that verified cryptography is mature enough for production use, providing enhanced security guarantees while meeting engineering standards in a major software project like Python.\nGetting Forked by Microsoft • Philip Laine Key Facts Philip Laine’s open source project Spegel was developed to address container image registry downtime issues without stateful components Microsoft contacted Laine to collaborate on Spegel; later, Microsoft developed Peerd, a forked project with significant code similarities and direct references to Spegel Peerd is a fork of Spegel, maintained by Microsoft under the MIT license, with test cases and code snippets directly copied from Spegel The copied code includes functions and comments identical to Spegel, causing confusion among users and raising concerns about proper attribution Laine’s Spegel has over 1,700 stars and 14.4 million pulls since its release, despite challenges posed by Microsoft’s actions and open source licensing dynamics Summary Philip Laine’s open source project Spegel, designed as a lightweight, non-stateful container image registry solution, was positively received with over 1,700 stars and 14.4 million pulls.

The feature enhances device security by encrypting data in the “Before First Unlock” (BFU) state and restricting access to PIN or passcode, making data retrieval more difficult. The update is silent, with no user notification, and is part of ongoing efforts to move system components to Google Play Services for faster updates. Similar to Apple’s Inactivity Reboot feature introduced in iOS 18.1, this limits device exposure by forcing reboots after periods of inactivity, reducing the risk of data extraction. The feature is designed to improve security, especially in scenarios where devices are left unattended for extended periods, and is expected to be available on most Android devices within a week or more. Summary A forthcoming Google Play Services update (version 25.14), officially released on April 14, 2025, will enable Android phones to automatically reboot after being locked and unused for three days. This silent feature aims to bolster security by encrypting user data in the “Before First Unlock” (BFU) state, where biometrics and location-based unlocking are disabled, and access is limited to PIN or passcode. The reboot process makes data extraction significantly more difficult, even with advanced recovery tools, by limiting the window during which unencrypted data is accessible.\nThis functionality mirrors Apple’s Inactivity Reboot introduced in iOS 18.1, which also aims to enhance device security by forcing reboots after inactivity, though it has caused concerns among law enforcement regarding data access. The update is part of Google’s strategy to shift system components to Google Play Services, allowing for automatic background updates without user intervention. The rollout is gradual, and most Android devices are expected to receive the feature within a week or more, contributing to improved device security and data protection.\nDeciphering Glyph :: Stop Writing __init__ Methods Key Facts The article critiques the traditional use of __init__ methods in Python classes, especially for data structures, highlighting their drawbacks. Before Python 3.7, __init__ was essential for constructing data classes, but alternatives had significant limitations. Overusing __init__ for side-effects or complex initialization links object creation with side-effects, leading to design issues. The proposed solution involves using @dataclass, @classmethod factory methods, and typing.NewType for better design. Implementing these techniques improves code robustness, testability, discoverability, and future-proofing. Summary The article argues that writing custom __init__ methods for data classes in Python introduces unnecessary complexity and side-effects, especially when handling more complex data structures like a FileReader. Historically, __init__ was necessary before Python 3.7’s introduction of dataclasses, but its overuse often leads to tightly coupled object creation and side-effects, complicating testing and maintenance. For example, a FileReader class that opens a file descriptor in __init__ becomes difficult to extend or modify, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations or external dependencies.\nThe author advocates replacing __init__ with @dataclass for attribute management, @classmethod factory methods for flexible object creation, and typing.NewType to enforce constraints on primitive types like int. This approach ensures objects are always valid upon creation, simplifies testing, and enhances discoverability of construction methods. For instance, FileReader.open() as a class method replaces direct constructor calls, allowing for asynchronous or alternative instantiation patterns without side-effects in __init__.\nBy adopting these patterns, developers can create robust, flexible, and future-proof classes that avoid the pitfalls of arbitrary code execution during object instantiation, leading to clearer, more maintainable, and testable codebases.\nLibrarians are dangerous. - The Enthusiast by Brad Montague Key Facts The article is a satirical public service announcement claiming “Librarians are dangerous.” Librarians are depicted as activists, educators, tech-savvy, myth-slayers, and organizers of rebellion.

British wartime science efforts focused on defense and intelligence tech, led by Professor Frederick Lindemann, with centralized government labs and no university involvement. U.S. wartime research was driven by Vannevar Bush, who established university-based, civilian-run labs through the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), funding $9 billion (2025 dollars) from 1941-1945. U.S. government funding post-WWII, notably via NSF, NASA, and DARPA, fostered a decentralized, collaborative innovation ecosystem centered around universities like MIT, Harvard, and Stanford. Britain’s post-war austerity and economic policies hindered scaling and commercialization of wartime innovations; the U.S. built a global leadership in science, technology, and industry, with university-industry-government partnerships fueling Silicon Valley and related sectors. In 2025, U.S. government support for university research declines, raising concerns about future global technological leadership. Summary Before WWII, the U.S. lagged behind Britain in science and engineering, but the war catalyzed a transformation driven by contrasting approaches to research and development. Britain’s wartime efforts, led by Professor Lindemann, relied on centralized government labs focused on defense and intelligence projects, with minimal university involvement. Their approach prioritized short-term survival amid daily bombings and economic constraints, resulting in significant breakthroughs like radar, sonar, and early computing, but lacked the scale and commercialization needed for post-war dominance.\nIn contrast, the U.S. under Vannevar Bush adopted a decentralized, university-centered model, creating civilian-run labs funded with $9 billion during the war. This fostered a collaborative ecosystem where universities like MIT, Harvard, and Stanford became innovation hubs, supported by large federal investments such as the NSF, NASA, and DARPA. This system enabled rapid development and commercialization of technologies like computers, nuclear power, and synthetic fibers, fueling economic growth and establishing U.S. global leadership.\nPost-war, Britain’s economic austerity and political shifts limited its capacity to scale innovations, while the U.S. built a robust, industry-integrated research infrastructure. The indirect cost reimbursement system allowed U.S. universities to develop world-class labs, attracting global talent and generating thousands of startups annually. This university-government-industry partnership became the foundation of Silicon Valley and other high-tech sectors.\nToday, China has invested heavily to surpass U.S. technological dominance, and concerns grow as U.S. federal support for university research diminishes in 2025, potentially ending decades of American leadership in science and technology.\nTLS Certificate Lifetimes Will Officially Reduce to 47 Days | DigiCert Key Facts The CA/Browser Forum voted to reduce TLS certificate lifetime to 47 days, with implementation phases starting March 15, 2026 Current maximum TLS certificate validity is 398 days; it will decrease to 200 days on March 15, 2026, then to 100 days on March 15, 2027, and finally to 47 days on March 15, 2029 Domain and IP address validation reuse periods will also decrease: from 398 days now to 10 days by March 15, 2029 Validations of Subject Identity Information (SII) in OV/EV certificates will be limited to 398 days from the current 825 days after March 15, 2026 The change emphasizes automation, as manual revalidation becomes impractical with shorter certificate lifetimes Summary The CA/Browser Forum has officially amended the TLS Baseline Requirements to significantly shorten TLS certificate lifetimes, with the maximum validity dropping from 398 days to 47 days by March 15, 2029. This phased reduction begins with a 200-day limit on March 15, 2026, followed by a 100-day limit on March 15, 2027, and ultimately reaching 47 days in 2029. Alongside this, the reuse period for domain and IP address validation information will decrease from 398 days to just 10 days, and validation of Subject Identity Information (SII) in OV and EV certificates will be limited to 398 days after March 15, 2026, down from 825 days.\nThe move aims to enhance security by mitigating risks associated with outdated certificate data and unreliable revocation systems, advocating for automation in certificate lifecycle management. Apple’s justification highlights that shorter lifetimes necessitate automation, with DigiCert supporting this transition through solutions like Trust Lifecycle Manager and CertCentral, including ACME support for automated issuance and renewal. The new schedule underscores the importance of adopting automation tools to prevent outages and streamline certificate management processes.\nDecreased CO2 saturation during circular breathwork supports emergence of altered states of consciousness | Communications Psychology Key Facts Study tracked physiological and experiential dynamics during circular breathwork (Holotropic and Conscious-Connected) in 61 experienced practitioners. End-tidal CO2 pressure (etCO2) decreased significantly in active-breathing groups, reaching levels below 20 mmHg, correlating with onset of altered states of consciousness (ASCs). Subjective ASC scores (MEQ-30 and 11D-ASC) during breathwork resembled those induced by psychedelics, with depth predicting improvements in well-being and reductions in depressive symptoms. Physiological changes included a significant drop in etCO2 during active breathwork, with trajectories highly similar across breathwork styles; reductions in CO2 were strongly linked to deeper ASCs. Post-session, active breathers showed decreased salivary α-amylase (sympathetic activity marker) and increased IL-1β (inflammatory marker), with subjective ASC depth moderating inflammation; follow-up assessments indicated improved mental health and well-being. Summary This study investigated the physiological and psychological mechanisms underlying circular breathwork, comparing Holotropic and Conscious-Connected techniques in 61 experienced practitioners. Results demonstrated that deliberate hyperventilation during active breathwork led to a significant reduction in end-tidal CO2 (etCO2), often below 20 mmHg, which was strongly associated with the emergence of altered states of consciousness (ASCs). These subjective experiences, measured via the MEQ-30 and 11D-ASC questionnaires, closely resembled psychedelic-induced ASCs, including ego dissolution and unity, and their intensity predicted subsequent improvements in mental health, such as decreased depressive symptoms and enhanced well-being.\nPhysiologically, active breathers showed a rapid decline in etCO2 during the session, with trajectories highly similar across both breathwork styles, indicating engagement of shared mechanisms. The depth of subjective ASC experiences correlated inversely with etCO2 levels, suggesting that CO2 reduction acts as a trigger for ASC onset. Post-session, biomarkers reflected a complex physiological response: a significant decrease in salivary α-amylase indicated reduced sympathetic activity, while IL-1β levels increased, with deeper ASCs associated with smaller inflammatory responses. These findings support the concept that physiological boundary conditions, notably CO2 depletion, facilitate ASC emergence in a non-pharmacological context, with subjective experience influencing long-term psychological and physiological outcomes.\nThe similarity in outcomes across both breathwork styles, despite differences in session duration, suggests that core physiological mechanisms—particularly CO2 modulation—are central to ASC induction. The results position circular breathwork as a potentially accessible therapeutic tool capable of eliciting psychedelic-like states, with implications for mental health treatment, especially where pharmacological interventions are restricted. Limitations include the reliance on experienced practitioners and the need for further research into long-term effects, safety, and the role of contextual factors such as set and setting.\nSynology Lost the Plot with Hard Drive Locking Move - ServeTheHome Key Facts Synology plans to restrict its 2025 Plus NAS models to using only Synology-branded hard drives This move enforces vendor lock-in, disabling features like volume-wide deduplication, lifespan analysis, and automatic firmware updates for third-party drives Synology’s Plus series currently supports drives up to 16TB (e.g., HAT3310-16T), whereas competitors like WD Red Pro support 26TB The restriction limits raw capacity to 128TB in an 8-bay NAS, compared to 208TB with other brands The move is viewed as a margin-boosting strategy that negatively impacts customer flexibility, data security, and long-term drive availability Summary Synology is reportedly moving towards locking its upcoming 2025 Plus NAS models to only support its own branded hard drives, as reported by HardwareLuxx. This change will disable key features such as volume-wide deduplication, lifespan analysis, and automatic firmware updates for third-party drives, effectively forcing users to buy Synology-branded drives. Currently, the Plus series supports drives up to 16TB, with the maximum raw capacity of an 8-bay NAS being 128TB, whereas competitors like WD Red Pro offer 26TB drives and a total capacity of 208TB in similar configurations.\nThe move appears to be a strategy to increase margins by rebranding drives from other manufacturers, which is criticized as detrimental to customer choice and data security. Vendor lock-in complicates drive replacement, especially when drives fail or need upgrading, and raises concerns about long-term availability and support. The restriction limits the ability to use drives from other vendors, which are often more readily available and have larger capacities, thus reducing flexibility and increasing dependency on Synology’s supply chain. Critics argue this approach is a step back from previous hardware standards and could harm Synology’s reputation, as many users prefer open hardware configurations like TrueNAS or custom-built solutions.\n▶️ Technology Start building with Gemini 2.5 Flash - Google Developers Blog Key Facts Google announced Gemini 2.5 Flash in early preview on April 17, 2025 Major upgrade over Gemini 2.0 Flash, enhancing reasoning capabilities while maintaining speed and cost efficiency First fully hybrid reasoning model, allowing developers to toggle “thinking” on or off and set reasoning budgets Supports reasoning through complex tasks with adjustable token budgets (0 to 24,576 tokens) Performs strongly on complex prompts, second only to Gemini 2.5 Pro on Hard Prompts in LMArena Adds fine-grained control over reasoning, enabling tradeoffs between quality, cost, and latency Available via Google AI Studio, Vertex AI, and Gemini app API parameter thinking_budget controls reasoning depth; ranges from 0 to 24,576 tokens Demonstrates improved reasoning for tasks like math problem solving and code generation Model pricing based on Google’s analysis and documentation Summary Google has introduced Gemini 2.5 Flash in early preview, available through the Gemini API via Google AI Studio, Vertex AI, and the Gemini app. Building on Gemini 2.0 Flash, this version significantly enhances reasoning capabilities while preserving speed and cost efficiency.

As of April 2025, Python now vendors <a href=https://github.com/project-everest/hacl-star/>HACL*</a>, a verified cryptographic library, for all default hash and HMAC algorithms, integrating 15,000 lines of verified C code. This transition was seamless for users and involved automating updates from upstream HACL*.</p><p>The integration required extensive technical work, including implementing new features such as additional Blake2 modes, a comprehensive SHA3 API covering all Keccak variants, and robust error handling, notably for memory allocation failures. The process involved developing a generic, formally verified streaming API for block algorithms using dependent types, accommodating diverse algorithm-specific requirements like pre-input data, variable output lengths, and state retention.</p><p>Handling build complexities, especially with platform-specific optimizations like AVX2 instructions, necessitated refactoring C code to use abstract structs, which was complicated by the auto-generated nature of the code from F* via krml. The project also incorporated rigorous CI testing across 50+ toolchains and architectures, revealing and addressing corner cases such as AVX2-dependent code in HMAC.</p><p>Memory failure propagation was achieved by integrating <code>option</code> types into the verification model, enabling failure detection and propagation through the cryptographic stack. Upstream updates from HACL* are now manageable via a shell script, simplifying maintenance.</p><p>This large-scale integration demonstrates that verified cryptography is mature enough for production use, providing enhanced security guarantees while meeting engineering standards in a major software project like Python.</p><hr><h3 id=getting-forked-by-microsoft--philip-laine><a href=https://philiplaine.com/posts/getting-forked-by-microsoft/>Getting Forked by Microsoft • Philip Laine</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#getting-forked-by-microsoft--philip-laine>#</a></h3><h3 id=key-facts-17>Key Facts<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#key-facts-17>#</a></h3><ul><li>Philip Laine&rsquo;s open source project Spegel was developed to address container image registry downtime issues without stateful components</li><li>Microsoft contacted Laine to collaborate on Spegel; later, Microsoft developed Peerd, a forked project with significant code similarities and direct references to Spegel</li><li>Peerd is a fork of Spegel, maintained by Microsoft under the MIT license, with test cases and code snippets directly copied from Spegel</li><li>The copied code includes functions and comments identical to Spegel, causing confusion among users and raising concerns about proper attribution</li><li>Laine&rsquo;s Spegel has over 1,700 stars and 14.4 million pulls since its release, despite challenges posed by Microsoft&rsquo;s actions and open source licensing dynamics</li></ul><h3 id=summary-17>Summary<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#summary-17>#</a></h3><p>Philip Laine&rsquo;s open source project Spegel, designed as a lightweight, non-stateful container image registry solution, was positively received with over 1,700 stars and 14.4 million pulls.

Historically, <code>__init__</code> was necessary before Python 3.7&rsquo;s introduction of <code>dataclasses</code>, but its overuse often leads to tightly coupled object creation and side-effects, complicating testing and maintenance. For example, a <code>FileReader</code> class that opens a file descriptor in <code>__init__</code> becomes difficult to extend or modify, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations or external dependencies.</p><p>The author advocates replacing <code>__init__</code> with <code>@dataclass</code> for attribute management, <code>@classmethod</code> factory methods for flexible object creation, and <code>typing.NewType</code> to enforce constraints on primitive types like <code>int</code>. This approach ensures objects are always valid upon creation, simplifies testing, and enhances discoverability of construction methods. For instance, <code>FileReader.open()</code> as a class method replaces direct constructor calls, allowing for asynchronous or alternative instantiation patterns without side-effects in <code>__init__</code>.</p><p>By adopting these patterns, developers can create robust, flexible, and future-proof classes that avoid the pitfalls of arbitrary code execution during object instantiation, leading to clearer, more maintainable, and testable codebases.</p><hr><h3 id=librarians-are-dangerous---the-enthusiast-by-brad-montague><a href=https://bradmontague.substack.com/p/librarians-are-dangerous>Librarians are dangerous. - The Enthusiast by Brad Montague</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#librarians-are-dangerous---the-enthusiast-by-brad-montague>#</a></h3><h3 id=key-facts-25>Key Facts<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#key-facts-25>#</a></h3><ul><li>The article is a satirical public service announcement claiming &ldquo;Librarians are dangerous.&rdquo;</li><li>Librarians are depicted as activists, educators, tech-savvy, myth-slayers, and organizers of rebellion.</li><li>They actively combat misinformation, censorship, outdated practices, apathy, and loneliness.</li><li>Modern librarians are described as capable of coding, curating, and influencing worldview through access to stories.</li><li>The message emphasizes librarians&rsquo; role in fostering empathy, curiosity, and societal change, especially through empowering youth with meaningful books.</li></ul><h3 id=summary-25>Summary<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#summary-25>#</a></h3><p>Brad Montague&rsquo;s article presents a provocative, humorous perspective on librarians, portraying them as &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; agents of societal transformation.

This shift resulted from a significant rise in wind and solar power, which collectively reached a record 24.4% of the national electricity mix. Solar power alone increased by 37% (+8.3 TWh), while wind power grew by 12% (+5.7 TWh) compared to the same month in 2024. The combined output of wind and solar hit an all-time high of 83 TWh, surpassing the previous record of 75 TWh set in April 2024 by 11%. Meanwhile, fossil fuel generation declined by 2.5% (-4.3 TWh) year-over-year.</p><p>This development reflects a long-term decline in fossil fuel reliance, with wind and solar expanding substantially over the past decade. In March 2015, fossil fuels accounted for 65% of US electricity, while wind and solar contributed only 5.7%. Today, wind and solar combined represent 17% of the US electricity mix, overtaking coal (15%) in 2024. Solar power&rsquo;s share has grown from 1% in March 2015 to 9.2% in March 2025, with over a third of new solar capacity installed in Texas. The trend indicates the US is approaching a tipping point where clean energy sources dominate, driven primarily by the continued growth of solar and wind power.

Britain’s wartime efforts, led by Professor Lindemann, relied on centralized government labs focused on defense and intelligence projects, with minimal university involvement. Their approach prioritized short-term survival amid daily bombings and economic constraints, resulting in significant breakthroughs like radar, sonar, and early computing, but lacked the scale and commercialization needed for post-war dominance.</p><p>In contrast, the U.S. under Vannevar Bush adopted a decentralized, university-centered model, creating civilian-run labs funded with $9 billion during the war. This fostered a collaborative ecosystem where universities like MIT, Harvard, and Stanford became innovation hubs, supported by large federal investments such as the NSF, NASA, and DARPA. This system enabled rapid development and commercialization of technologies like computers, nuclear power, and synthetic fibers, fueling economic growth and establishing U.S. global leadership.</p><p>Post-war, Britain’s economic austerity and political shifts limited its capacity to scale innovations, while the U.S. built a robust, industry-integrated research infrastructure. The indirect cost reimbursement system allowed U.S. universities to develop world-class labs, attracting global talent and generating thousands of startups annually. This university-government-industry partnership became the foundation of Silicon Valley and other high-tech sectors.</p><p>Today, China has invested heavily to surpass U.S. technological dominance, and concerns grow as U.S. federal support for university research diminishes in 2025, potentially ending decades of American leadership in science and technology.</p><hr><h3 id=tls-certificate-lifetimes-will-officially-reduce-to-47-days--digicert><a href=https://www.digicert.com/blog/tls-certificate-lifetimes-will-officially-reduce-to-47-days>TLS Certificate Lifetimes Will Officially Reduce to 47 Days | DigiCert</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#tls-certificate-lifetimes-will-officially-reduce-to-47-days--digicert>#</a></h3><h3 id=key-facts-30>Key Facts<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#key-facts-30>#</a></h3><ul><li>The CA/Browser Forum voted to reduce TLS certificate lifetime to 47 days, with implementation phases starting March 15, 2026</li><li>Current maximum TLS certificate validity is 398 days; it will decrease to 200 days on March 15, 2026, then to 100 days on March 15, 2027, and finally to 47 days on March 15, 2029</li><li>Domain and IP address validation reuse periods will also decrease: from 398 days now to 10 days by March 15, 2029</li><li>Validations of Subject Identity Information (SII) in OV/EV certificates will be limited to 398 days from the current 825 days after March 15, 2026</li><li>The change emphasizes automation, as manual revalidation becomes impractical with shorter certificate lifetimes</li></ul><h3 id=summary-30>Summary<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#summary-30>#</a></h3><p>The CA/Browser Forum has officially amended the TLS Baseline Requirements to significantly shorten TLS certificate lifetimes, with the maximum validity dropping from 398 days to 47 days by March 15, 2029.

Results demonstrated that deliberate hyperventilation during active breathwork led to a significant reduction in end-tidal CO2 (etCO2), often below 20 mmHg, which was strongly associated with the emergence of altered states of consciousness (ASCs). These subjective experiences, measured via the MEQ-30 and 11D-ASC questionnaires, closely resembled psychedelic-induced ASCs, including ego dissolution and unity, and their intensity predicted subsequent improvements in mental health, such as decreased depressive symptoms and enhanced well-being.</p><p>Physiologically, active breathers showed a rapid decline in etCO2 during the session, with trajectories highly similar across both breathwork styles, indicating engagement of shared mechanisms. The depth of subjective ASC experiences correlated inversely with etCO2 levels, suggesting that CO2 reduction acts as a trigger for ASC onset. Post-session, biomarkers reflected a complex physiological response: a significant decrease in salivary α-amylase indicated reduced sympathetic activity, while IL-1β levels increased, with deeper ASCs associated with smaller inflammatory responses. These findings support the concept that physiological boundary conditions, notably CO2 depletion, facilitate ASC emergence in a non-pharmacological context, with subjective experience influencing long-term psychological and physiological outcomes.</p><p>The similarity in outcomes across both breathwork styles, despite differences in session duration, suggests that core physiological mechanisms—particularly CO2 modulation—are central to ASC induction. The results position circular breathwork as a potentially accessible therapeutic tool capable of eliciting psychedelic-like states, with implications for mental health treatment, especially where pharmacological interventions are restricted. Limitations include the reliance on experienced practitioners and the need for further research into long-term effects, safety, and the role of contextual factors such as set and setting.</p><hr><h3 id=synology-lost-the-plot-with-hard-drive-locking-move---servethehome><a href=https://www.servethehome.com/synology-lost-the-plot-with-hard-drive-locking-move/>Synology Lost the Plot with Hard Drive Locking Move - ServeTheHome</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#synology-lost-the-plot-with-hard-drive-locking-move---servethehome>#</a></h3><h3 id=key-facts-32>Key Facts<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#key-facts-32>#</a></h3><ul><li>Synology plans to restrict its 2025 Plus NAS models to using only Synology-branded hard drives</li><li>This move enforces vendor lock-in, disabling features like volume-wide deduplication, lifespan analysis, and automatic firmware updates for third-party drives</li><li>Synology’s Plus series currently supports drives up to 16TB (e.g., HAT3310-16T), whereas competitors like WD Red Pro support 26TB</li><li>The restriction limits raw capacity to 128TB in an 8-bay NAS, compared to 208TB with other brands</li><li>The move is viewed as a margin-boosting strategy that negatively impacts customer flexibility, data security, and long-term drive availability</li></ul><h3 id=summary-32>Summary<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#summary-32>#</a></h3><p>Synology is reportedly moving towards locking its upcoming 2025 Plus NAS models to only support its own branded hard drives, as reported by <a href=https://www.hardwareluxx.de/index.php/news/hardware/festplatten/65949-synology-weitet-den-zwang-zur-eignen-oder-zertifizierten-festplatte-auf-die-plus-modelle-aus.html>HardwareLuxx</a>. This change will disable key features such as volume-wide deduplication, lifespan analysis, and automatic firmware updates for third-party drives, effectively forcing users to buy Synology-branded drives. Currently, the Plus series supports drives up to 16TB, with the maximum raw capacity of an 8-bay NAS being 128TB, whereas competitors like WD Red Pro offer 26TB drives and a total capacity of 208TB in similar configurations.</p><p>The move appears to be a strategy to increase margins by rebranding drives from other manufacturers, which is criticized as detrimental to customer choice and data security. Vendor lock-in complicates drive replacement, especially when drives fail or need upgrading, and raises concerns about long-term availability and support. The restriction limits the ability to use drives from other vendors, which are often more readily available and have larger capacities, thus reducing flexibility and increasing dependency on Synology’s supply chain.
